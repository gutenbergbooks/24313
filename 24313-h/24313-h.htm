<h2>THE HEIR</h2>

<h3 class="h3sm">I.&mdash;HE INTRODUCES HIMSELF</h3>

<p class="cap">"<span class="dcap">In</span> less refined circles than ours," I said to Myra,
"your behaviour would be described as swank.
Really, to judge from the airs you put on, you
might be the child's mother."</p>

<p>"He's jealous because he's not an aunt himself.
Isn't he, ducksey darling?"</p>

<p>"I do wish you wouldn't keep dragging the baby
into the conversation; we can make it go quite well
as a duologue. As to being jealous&mdash;why, it's absurd.
True, I'm not an aunt, but in a very short time I shall
be an uncle by marriage, which sounds to me much
superior. That is," I added, "if you're still equal
to it."</p>

<p>Myra blew me a kiss over the cradle.</p>

<p>"Another thing you've forgotten," I went on, "is
that I'm down for a place as a godfather. Archie tells
me that it isn't settled yet, but that there's a good
deal of talk about it in the clubs. Who's the other
going to be? Not Thomas, I suppose? That would
be making the thing rather a farce."</p>

<p>"Hasn't Dahlia broken it to you?" said Myra
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Simpson?" I asked, in an awed whisper.</p>

<p>Myra nodded. "And, of course, Thomas," she
said.</p>

<p>"Heavens! Not three of us? What a jolly crowd
we shall be. Thomas can play our best ball. We
might&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"But of course there are only going to be two godfathers,"
she said, and leant over the cradle again.</p>

<p>I held up my three end fingers. "Thomas," I said,
pointing to the smallest, "me," I explained, pointing
to the next, "and Simpson, the tall gentleman in
glasses. One, two, three."</p>

<p>"Oh, baby," sighed Myra, "what a very slow uncle
by marriage you're going to have!"</p>

<p>I stood and gazed at my three fingers for some
time.</p>

<p>"I've got it," I said at last, and I pulled down the
middle one. "The rumour in the clubs was unauthorized.
I don't get a place after all."</p>

<p>"<i>Don't</i> say you mind," pleaded Myra. "You see,
Dahlia thought that as you were practically one of
the family already, an uncle-elect by marriage, and
as she didn't want to choose between Thomas and
Samuel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say no more. I was only afraid that she might
have something against my moral character. Child,"
I went on, rising and addressing the unresponsive
infant, "England has lost a godfather this day, but
the world has gained a&mdash;&mdash;what? I don't know. I
want my tea."</p>

<p>Myra gave the baby a last kiss and got up.</p>

<p>"Can I trust him with you while I go and see about
Dahlia?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure. It depends how I feel. I may change
him with some poor baby in the village. Run away,
aunt, and leave us men to ourselves. We have several
matters to discuss."</p>

<p>When the child and I were alone together, I knelt
by his cradle and surveyed his features earnestly.
I wanted to see what it was he had to offer Myra
which I could not give her. "This," I said to myself,
"is the face which has come between her and me," for
it was unfortunately true that I could no longer claim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Myra's undivided attention. But the more I looked at
him the more mysterious the whole thing became
to me.</p>

<p>"Not a bad kid?" said a voice behind me.</p>

<p>I turned and saw Archie.</p>

<p>"Yours, I believe," I said, and I waved him to the
cradle.</p>

<p>Archie bent down and tickled the baby's chin,
making appropriate noises the while&mdash;one of the things
a father has to learn to do.</p>

<p>"Who do you think he's like?" he asked proudly.</p>

<p>"The late Mr. Gladstone," I said, after deep
thought.</p>

<p>"Wrong. Hallo, here's Dahlia coming out. I hope,
for your sake, that the baby's all right. If she finds
he's caught measles or anything, you'll get into
trouble."</p>

<p>By a stroke of bad luck the child began to cry as
soon as he saw the ladies. Myra rushed up to him.</p>

<p>"Poor little darling," she said soothingly. "Did
his uncle by marriage frighten him, then?"</p>

<p>"Don't listen to her, Dahlia," I said. "I haven't
done anything to him. We were chatting together
quite amicably until he suddenly caught sight of Myra
and burst into tears."</p>

<p>"He's got a little pain," said Dahlia gently taking
him up and patting him.</p>

<p>"I think the trouble is mental," suggested Archie.
"He looks to me as if he had something on his conscience.
Did he say anything to you about it when
you were alone?"</p>

<p>"He didn't say much," I confessed, "but he seemed
to be keeping something back. I think he wants a bit
of a run, really."</p>

<p>"Poor little lamb," said Dahlia. "There, he's
better now, thank you." She looked up at Archie
and me. "I don't believe you two love him a bit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Archie smiled at his wife and went over to the tea-table
to pour out. I sat on the grass and tried to
analyse my feelings to my nephew by marriage.</p>

<p>"As an acquaintance," I said, "he is charming;
I know no one who is better company. If I cannot
speak of his more solid qualities, it is only because I
do not know him well enough. But to say whether
I love him or not is difficult; I could tell you better
after our first quarrel. However, there is one thing
I must confess. I am rather jealous of him."</p>

<p>"You envy his life of idleness?"</p>

<p>"No, I envy him the amount of attention he gets
from Myra. The love she wastes on him which might
be better employed on me is a heartrending thing to
witness. As her betrothed I should expect to occupy
the premier place in her affections, but, really, I sometimes
think that if the baby and I both fell into the
sea she would jump in and save the baby first."</p>

<p>"Don't talk about his falling into the sea," said
Dahlia, with a shudder; "I can't a-bear it."</p>

<p>"I think it will be all right," said Archie, "I was
touching wood all the time."</p>

<p>"What a silly godfather he nearly had!" whispered
Myra at the cradle. "It quite makes you smile,
doesn't it, baby? Oh, Dahlia, he's just like Archie
when he smiles!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he's the living image of Archie," said
Dahlia confidently.</p>

<p>I looked closely at Archie and then at the baby.</p>

<p>"I should always know them apart," I said at last.
"That," and I pointed to the one at the tea-table, "is
Archie, and this," and I pointed to the one in the
cradle, "is the baby. But then I've such a wonderful
memory for faces."</p>

<p>"Baby," said Myra, "I'm afraid you're going to
know some very foolish people."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="h3sm">II.&mdash;HE MEETS HIS GODFATHERS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span> and Simpson arrived by the twelve-thirty
train, and Myra and I drove down in the wagonette
to meet them. Myra handled the ribbons ("handled
the ribbons"&mdash;we must have that again) while I sat
on the box-seat and pointed out any traction-engines
and things in the road. I am very good at this.</p>

<p>"I suppose," I said, "there will be some sort of
ceremony at the station? The station-master will
read an address while his little daughter presents a
bouquet of flowers. You don't often get two godfathers
travelling by the same train. Look out," I said,
as we swung round a corner, "there's an ant coming."</p>

<p>"What did you say? I'm so sorry, but I listen
awfully badly when I'm driving."</p>

<p>"As soon as I hit upon anything really good I'll
write it down. So far I have been throwing off the
merest trifles. When we are married, Myra&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on; I love that."</p>

<p>"When we are married we shan't be able to afford
horses, so we'll keep a couple of bicycles, and you'll be
able to hear everything I say. How jolly for you."</p>

<p>"All right," said Myra quietly.</p>

<p>There was no formal ceremony on the platform, but
I did not seem to feel the want of it when I saw Simpson
stepping from the train with an enormous Teddy-bear
under his arm.</p>

<p>"Hallo, dear old chap," he said, "here we are!
You're looking at my bear. I quite forgot it until I'd
strapped up my bags, so I had to bring it like this.
It squeaks," he added, as if that explained it. "Listen,"
and the piercing roar of the bear resounded through
the station.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very fine. Hallo, Thomas!"</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said Thomas, and went to look after his
luggage.</p>

<p>"I hope he'll like it," Simpson went on. "Its legs
move up and down." He put them into several positions,
and then squeaked it again. "Jolly, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Ripping," I agreed. "Who's it for?"</p>

<p>He looked at me in astonishment for a moment.</p>

<p>"My dear old chap, for the baby."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. That's awfully nice of you. He'll love
it." I wondered if Simpson had ever seen a month-old
baby. "What's its name?"</p>

<p>"I've been calling it Duncan in the train, but, of
course, he will want to choose his own name for it."</p>

<p>"Well, you must talk it over with him to-night after
the ladies have gone to bed. How about your luggage?
We mustn't keep Myra waiting."</p>

<p>"Hallo, Thomas!" said Myra, as we came out.
"Hallo, Samuel! Hooray!"</p>

<p>"Hallo, Myra!" said Thomas. "All right?"</p>

<p>"Myra, this is Duncan," said Simpson, and the
shrill roar of the bear rang out once more.</p>

<p>Myra, her mouth firm, but smiles in her eyes, looked
down lovingly at him. Sometimes I think that she
would like to be Simpson's mother. Perhaps, when we
are married, we might adopt him.</p>

<p>"For baby?" she said, stroking it with her whip.
"But he won't be allowed to take it into church with
him, you know. No, Thomas, I won't have the luggage
next to me; I want some one to talk to. You come."</p>

<p>Inside the wagonette Simpson squeaked his bear at
intervals, while I tried to prepare him for his coming
introduction to his godson. Having known the baby
for nearly a week, and being to some extent in Myra's
confidence, I felt quite the family man beside Simpson.</p>

<p>"You must try not to be disappointed with his
looks," I said. "Anyway, don't let Dahlia think you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
are. And if you want to do the right thing say that
he's just like Archie. Archie doesn't mind this for
some reason."</p>

<p>"Is he tall for his age?"</p>

<p>"Samuel, pull yourself together. He isn't tall at all.
If he is anything he is long, but how long only those
can say who have seen him in his bath. You do
realize that he is only a month old?"</p>

<p>"My dear old boy, of course. One can't expect
much from him. I suppose he isn't even toddling
about yet?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no. Not actually toddling."</p>

<p>"Well, we can teach him later on. And I'm going
to have a lot of fun with him. I shall show him my
watch&mdash;babies always love that."</p>

<p>There was a sudden laugh from the front, which
changed just a little too late into a cough. The fact
is I had bet Myra a new golf-ball that Simpson would
show the baby his watch within two minutes of meeting
him. Of course, it wasn't a certainty yet, but I
thought there would be no harm in mentioning the
make of ball I preferred. So I changed the conversation
subtly to golf.</p>

<p>Amidst loud roars from the bear we drove up to the
house and were greeted by Archie.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Thomas! how are you? Hallo, Simpson!
Good heavens! I know that face. Introduce me,
Samuel."</p>

<p>"This is Duncan. I brought him down for your boy
to play with."</p>

<p>"Duncan, of course. The boy will love it. He's
tired of me already. He proposes to meet his godfathers
at four p.m. precisely. So you'll have nearly
three hours to think of something genial to say to him."</p>

<p>We spent the last of the three hours playing tennis,
and at four p.m. precisely the introduction took place.
By great good luck Duncan was absent; Simpson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
would have wasted his whole two minutes in making
it squeak.</p>

<p>"Baby," said Dahlia, "this is your Uncle Thomas."</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said Thomas, gently kissing the baby's
hand. "Good old boy," and he felt for his pipe.</p>

<p>"Baby," said Dahlia, "this is your Uncle Samuel."</p>

<p>As he leant over the child I whipped out my watch
and murmured, "Go!" 4 hrs. 1 min. 25 sec. I wished
Myra had not taken my "two minutes" so literally,
but I felt that the golf-ball was safe.</p>

<p>Simpson looked at the baby as if fascinated, and the
baby stared back at him. It was a new experience for
both of them.</p>

<p>"He's <i>just</i> like Archie," he said at last, remembering
my advice. "Only smaller," he added.</p>

<p>4 hrs. 2 min. 7 sec.</p>

<p>"I can see you, baby," he said. "Goo-goo."</p>

<p>Myra came and rested her chin on my shoulder.
Silently I pointed to the finishing place on my watch,
and she gave a little gurgle of excitement. There was
only one minute left.</p>

<p>"I wonder what you're thinking about," said
Simpson to the baby. "Is it my glasses you want to
play with?"</p>

<p>"Help!" I murmured. "This will never do."</p>

<p>"He just looks and looks. Ah! but his Uncle
Samuel knows what baby wants to see." (I squeezed
Myra's arm. 4 hrs. 3 mins. 10 secs. There was just
time.) "I wonder if it's anything in his uncle's waistcoat?"</p>

<p>"No!" whispered Myra to me in agony. "<i>Certainly</i>
not."</p>

<p>"He <i>shall</i> see it if he wants to," said Simpson soothingly,
and put his hand to his waistcoat pocket. I
smiled triumphantly at Myra. He had five seconds to
get the watch out&mdash;plenty of time.</p>

<p>"Bother!" said Simpson. "I left it upstairs."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="h3sm">III.&mdash;HE CHOOSES A NAME</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> afternoon being wet we gathered round the billiard-room
fire and went into committee.</p>

<p>"The question before the House," said Archie, "is
what shall the baby be called, and why. Dahlia and
I have practically decided on his names, but it would
amuse us to hear your inferior suggestions and point
out how ridiculous they are."</p>

<p>Godfather Simpson looked across in amazement at
Godfather Thomas.</p>

<p>"Really, you are taking a good deal upon yourself,
Archie," he said coldly. "It is entirely a matter for
my colleague and myself to decide whether the ground
is fit for&mdash;to decide, I should say, what the child is to
be called. Unless this is quite understood we shall
hand in our resignations."</p>

<p>"We've been giving a lot of thought to it," said
Thomas, opening his eyes for a moment. "And our
time is valuable." He arranged the cushions at his
back and closed his eyes again.</p>

<p>"Well, as a matter of fact, the competition isn't
quite closed," said Archie. "Entries can still be
received."</p>

<p>"We haven't really decided at all," put in Dahlia
gently. "It <i>is</i> so difficult."</p>

<p>"In that case," said Samuel, "Thomas and I will
continue to act. It is my pleasant duty to inform you
that we had a long consultation yesterday, and finally
agreed to call him&mdash;er&mdash;Samuel Thomas."</p>

<p>"Thomas Samuel," said Thomas sleepily.</p>

<p>"How did you think of those names?" I asked.
"It must have taken you a tremendous time."</p>

<p>"With a name like Samuel Thomas Mannering,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
went on Simpson ["Thomas Samuel Mannering," murmured
Thomas], "your child might achieve almost anything.
In private life you would probably call him
Sam."</p>

<p>"Tom," said a tired voice.</p>

<p>"Or, more familiarly, Sammy."</p>

<p>"Tommy," came in a whisper from the sofa.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" asked Dahlia.</p>

<p>"I mustn't say," said Archie; "they're my guests.
But I'll tell you privately some time."</p>

<p>There was silence for a little, and then a thought
occurred to me.</p>

<p>"You know, Archie," I said, "limited as their ideas
are, you're rather in their power. Because I was looking
through the service in church on Sunday, and there
comes a point when the clergyman says to the godfathers,
'Name this child.' Well, there you are, you
know. They've got you. You may have fixed on
Montmorency Plantagenet, but they've only to say
'Bert,' and the thing is done."</p>

<p>"You all forget," said Myra, coming over to sit on
the arm of my chair, "that there's a godmother too.
I shall forbid the Berts."</p>

<p>"Well, that makes it worse. You'll have Myra
saying 'Montmorency Plantagenet,' and Samuel saying
'Samuel Thomas,' and Thomas saying 'Thomas
Samuel.'"</p>

<p>"It will sound rather well," said Archie, singing it
over to himself. "Thomas, you take the tenor part,
of course: 'Thomas Samuel, Thomas Samuel, Thom-as
Sam-u-el.' We must have a rehearsal."</p>

<p>For five minutes Myra, Thomas, and Simpson chanted
in harmony, being assisted after the first minute by
Archie, who took the alto part of "Solomon Joel."
He explained that as this was what he and his wife
really wanted the child christened ("Montmorency
Plantagenet" being only an invention of the godmother's)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
it would probably be necessary for him to
join in too.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Dahlia, when she could bear it no
longer; "you'll wake baby."</p>

<p>There was an immediate hush.</p>

<p>"Samuel," said Archie in a whisper, "if you wake
the baby I'll kill you."</p>

<p>The question of his name was still not quite
settled, and once more we gave ourselves up to
thought.</p>

<p>"Seeing that he's the very newest little Rabbit,"
said Myra, "I do think he might be called after some
very great cricketer."</p>

<p>"That was the idea in christening him 'Samuel,'"
said Archie.</p>

<p>"Gaukrodger Carkeek Butt Bajana Mannering," I
suggested&mdash;"something like that?"</p>

<p>"Silly; I meant 'Charles,' after Fry."</p>

<p>"'Schofield,' after Haigh," murmured Thomas.</p>

<p>"'Warren,' after Bardsley, would be more appropriate
to a Rabbit," said Simpson, beaming round at
us. There was, however, no laughter. We had all
just thought of it ourselves.</p>

<p>"The important thing in christening a future first-class
cricketer," said Simpson, "is to get the initials
right. What could be better than 'W. G.' as a nickname
for Grace? But if 'W. G.'s' initials had been
'Z. Z.,' where would you have been?"</p>

<p>"Here," said Archie.</p>

<p>The shock of this reply so upset Simpson that his
glasses fell off. He picked them out of the fender and
resumed his theme.</p>

<p>"Now, if the baby were christened 'Samuel Thomas'
his initials would be 'S. T.,' which are perfect. And
the same as Coleridge's."</p>

<p>"Is that Coleridge the wicket-keeper, or the fast
bowler?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Simpson opened his mouth to explain, and then,
just in time, decided not to.</p>

<p>"I forgot to say," said Archie, "that anyhow he's
going to be called Blair, after his mamma."</p>

<p>"If his name's Blair Mannering," I said at once,
"he'll have to write a book. You can't waste a name
like that. <i>The Crimson Spot</i>, by Blair Mannering.
Mr. Blair Mannering, the well-known author of <i>The
Gash</i>. Our new serial, <i>The Stain on the Bath Mat</i>, has
been specially written for us by Mr. and Mrs. Blair
Mannering. It's simply asking for it."</p>

<p>"Don't talk about his wife yet, please," smiled
Dahlia. "Let me have him a little while."</p>

<p>"Well, he can be a writer <i>and</i> a cricketer. Why
not? There are others. I need only mention my
friend, S. Simpson."</p>

<p>"But the darling still wants another name," said
Myra. "Let's call him John to-day, and William to-morrow,
and Henry the next day, and so on until we
find out what suits him best."</p>

<p>"Let's all go upstairs now and call him Samuel,"
said Samuel.</p>

<p>"Thomas," said Thomas.</p>

<p>We looked at Dahlia. She got up and moved to the
door. In single file we followed her on tip-toe to the
nursery. The baby was fast asleep.</p>

<p>"Thomas," we all said in a whisper, "Thomas,
Thomas."</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>"Samuel!"</p>

<p>Dead silence.</p>

<p>"I think," said Dahlia, "we'll call him Peter."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="h3sm">IV.&mdash;HE IS CHRISTENED</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of the christening, as I was on my
way to the bathroom, I met Simpson coming out of
it. There are people who have never seen Simpson in
his dressing-gown; people also who have never waited
for the sun to rise in glory above the snow-capped peaks
of the Alps; who have never stood on Waterloo Bridge
and watched St. Paul's come through the mist of an
October morning. Well, well, one cannot see everything.</p>

<p>"Hallo, old chap!" he said. "I was just coming
to talk to you. I want your advice."</p>

<p>"A glass of hot water the last thing at night," I said,
"no sugar or milk, a Turkish bath once a week and
plenty of exercise. You'll get it down in no time."</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass. I mean about the christening.
I've been to a wedding, of course, but that isn't quite
the same thing."</p>

<p>"A moment, while I turn on the tap." I turned it
on and came back to him. "Now then, I'm at your
service."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the&mdash;er&mdash;usual costume for a christening?"</p>

<p>"Leave that to the mother," I said. "She'll see
that the baby's dressed properly."</p>

<p>"I mean for a godfather."</p>

<p>Dahlia has conveniently placed a sofa outside the
bathroom door. I dropped into it and surveyed the
dressing-gown thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Go like that," I said at last.</p>

<p>"What I want to know is whether it's a top-hat
affair or not?"</p>

<p>"Have you brought a top-hat?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Then you must certainly&mdash;&mdash; I say! Come out
of it, Myra!"</p>

<p>I jumped up from the sofa, but it was too late. She
had stolen my bath.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the cheek&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door opened and Myra's head appeared round
the corner.</p>

<p>"Hush! you'll wake the baby," she said. "Oh,
Samuel, what a dream! <i>Why</i> haven't I seen it before?"</p>

<p>"You have, Myra. I've often dressed up in it."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose it looks different with a sponge.
Because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Really!" I said as I took hold of Simpson and led
him firmly away; "if the baby knew that you carried
on like this of a morning he'd be shocked."</p>

<p>Thomas is always late for breakfast. Simpson on
this occasion was delayed by his elaborate toilet. They
came in last together, by opposite doors, and stood
staring at each other. Simpson wore a frock-coat,
dashing double-breasted waistcoat, perfectly creased
trousers, and a magnificent cravat; Thomas had on
flannels and an old blazer.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Archie, seeing Simpson first, "you
<i>are</i> a&mdash;&mdash;" and then he caught sight of Thomas.
"Hul-<i>lo</i>!" His eyes went from one to the other, and
at last settled on the toast. He went on with his
breakfast. "The two noble godfathers," he murmured.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two godfathers continued to gaze at
each other as if fascinated. At last Simpson spoke.</p>

<p>"We can't <i>both</i> be right," he said slowly to himself.</p>

<p>Thomas woke up.</p>

<p>"Is it the christening to-day? I quite forgot."</p>

<p>"It is, Thomas. The boat-race is to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Well, I can change afterwards. You don't expect
me to wear anything like that?" he said, pointing to
Simpson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't change," said Archie. "Both go as you are.
Mick and Mack, the Comedy Duo. Simpson does the
talking while Thomas falls over the pews."</p>

<p>Simpson collected his breakfast and sat down next
to Myra.</p>

<p>"Am I all right?" he asked her doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Your tie's up at the back of your neck," I said.</p>

<p>"Because if Dahlia would prefer it," he went on,
ignoring me, "I could easily wear a plain dark
tweed."</p>

<p>"You're beautiful, Samuel," said Myra. "I hope
you'll look as nice at my wedding."</p>

<p>"You don't think I shall be mistaken for the
father?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"By Peter? Well, that <i>is</i> just possible. Perhaps
if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think you're right," said Simpson, and after
breakfast he changed into the plain dark tweed.</p>

<p>As the hour approached we began to collect in the
hall, Simpson reading the service to himself for the
twentieth time.</p>

<p>"Do we have to say anything?" asked Thomas, as
he lit his third pipe.</p>

<p>Simpson looked at him in horror.</p>

<p>"Say anything? Of course we do! Haven't you
studied it? Here, you'll just have time to read it
through."</p>

<p>"Too late now. Better leave it to the inspiration
of the moment," I suggested. "Does anybody know
if there's a collection, because if so I shall have to go
and get some money."</p>

<p>"There will be a collection for the baby afterwards,"
said Archie. "I hope you've all been saving up."</p>

<p>"Here he comes!" said Simpson, and Peter Blair
Mannering came down the stairs with Dahlia and Myra.</p>

<p>"Good morning, everybody," said Dahlia.</p>

<p>"Good morning. Say 'Good morning,' baby."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's rather nervous," said Myra. "He says he's
never been christened before, and what's it like?"</p>

<p>"I expect he'll be all right with two such handsome
godfathers," said Dahlia.</p>

<p>"<i>Isn't</i> Mr. Simpson looking well?" said Myra in a
society voice. "And do you know, dear, that's the
<i>third</i> suit I've seen him in to-day."</p>

<p>"Well, are we all ready?"</p>

<p>"You're quite sure about his name?" said Archie
to his wife. "This is your last chance, you know. Say
the word to Thomas before it's too late."</p>

<p>"I think Peter is rather silly," I said.</p>

<p>"Why Blair?" said Myra. "I ask you."</p>

<p>Dahlia smiled sweetly at us and led the way with
P. B. Mannering to the car. We followed ... and
Simpson on the seat next the driver read the service
to himself for the last time.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>"I feel very proud," said Archie as we came out of
the church. "I'm not only a father, but my son has
a name. And now I needn't call him 'er' any more."</p>

<p>"He <i>was</i> a good boy, wasn't he?" said Myra.</p>

<p>"Thomas, say at once that your godson was a good
boy."</p>

<p>But Thomas was quiet. He looked years older.</p>

<p>"I've never read the service before," he said. "I
didn't quite know what we were in for. It seems that
Simpson and I have undertaken a heavy responsibility;
we are practically answerable for the child's education.
We are supposed to examine him every few years and
find out if he is being taught properly."</p>

<p>"You can bowl to him later on if you like."</p>

<p>"No, no. It means more than that." He turned to
Dahlia. "I think," he said, "Simpson and I will walk
home. We must begin at once to discuss the lines on
which we shall educate our child."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="h3sm">V.&mdash;HE SEES LIFE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no one in sight. If 'twere done well, 'twere
well done quickly. I gripped the perambulator, took
a last look round, and then suddenly rushed it across
the drive and down a side path, not stopping until
we were well concealed from the house. Panting, I
dropped into a seat, having knocked several seconds
off the quarter-mile record for babies under one.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said Myra.</p>

<p>"Dash it, are there people everywhere to-day? I
can't get a moment to myself. 'O solitude, where&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with baby?"</p>

<p>"Peter and I are going for a walk." My eyes rested
on her for more than a moment. She was looking at
me over an armful of flowers ... and&mdash;well&mdash;"You
can come too if you like," I said.</p>

<p>"I've got an awful lot to do," she smiled doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you'd rather count the washing."</p>

<p>She sat down next to me.</p>

<p>"Where's Dahlia?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. We meant to have left a note for
her, but we came away in rather a hurry. '<i>Back at
twelve. Peter.</i>'"</p>

<p>"'<i>I am quite happy. Pursuit is useless</i>,'" suggested
Myra. "Poor Dahlia, she'll be frightened when she
sees the perambulator gone."</p>

<p>"My dear, what <i>could</i> happen to it? Is this
Russia?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what happens to perambulators in Russia?"
asked Myra eagerly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"They spell them differently," I said, after a little
thought. "Anyhow, Dahlia's all right."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll just take these flowers in and then I'll
come back. If you and Peter will have me?"</p>

<p>"I think so," I said.</p>

<p>Myra went in and left me to my reflections, which
were mainly that Peter had the prettiest aunt in
England, and that the world was very good. But my
pleased and fatuous smile over these thoughts was
disturbed by her announcement on her return.</p>

<p>"Dahlia says," she began, "that we may have Peter
for an hour, but he must come in at once if he cries."</p>

<p>I got up in disgust.</p>

<p>"You've spoilt my morning," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>no</i>!"</p>

<p>"I had a little secret from Dahlia, or rather Peter
and I had a little secret together; at least, you and I
and Peter had a secret. Anyhow, it was a secret. And
I was feeling very wicked and happy&mdash;Peter and I both
were; and we were going to let you feel wicked too.
And now Dahlia knows all about the desperate deed
we were planning, and, to make it worse, all she says
is, 'Certainly! By all means! Only don't get his feet
wet.' Peter," I said, as I bent over the sleeping innocent,
"we are betrayed."</p>

<p>"Miss Mannering will now relate her experiences,"
said Myra. "I went into the hall to put down the
flowers, and just as I was coming out I saw Dahlia in
the corner with a book. And she said, 'Tell your
young man&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"How vulgar!" I interrupted.</p>

<p>"'Do be careful with my baby.' And I said in great
surprise, 'What baby?' And she said, 'He was very
kindly running him up and down the drive just now.
Peter loves it, but don't let them go on too long or
there may be an accident.' And then she gave a few
more instructions, and&mdash;here we are."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Peter," I said to the somnolent one, "you can't
deceive a woman. Also men are pigs. Wake up, and
we will apologize to your aunt for doubting her. Sorry,
Myra."</p>

<p>Myra pinned a flower in my coat and forgave me, and
we walked off together with the perambulator.</p>

<p>"Peter is seeing a bit of life this morning," I said.
"What shall we show him now?"</p>

<p>"Thomas and Samuel are playing golf," said Myra
casually.</p>

<p>I looked at her doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Is that quite suitable?"</p>

<p>"I think if we didn't let him stay too long it would
be all right. Dahlia wouldn't like him to be overexcited."</p>

<p>"Well, he can't be introduced to the game too early.
Come on, Peter." And we pushed into more open
country.</p>

<p>The 9-hole course which Simpson planned a year
ago is not yet used for the Open Championship,
though it is certainly better than it was last summer.
But it is short and narrow and dog-legged,
and, particularly when Simpson is playing on it,
dangerous.</p>

<p>"We are now in the zone of fire," I said. "Samuel's
repainted ninepenny may whiz past us at any moment.
Perhaps I had better go first." I tied my handkerchief
to Myra's sunshade and led the way with the white
flag.</p>

<p>A ball came over the barn and rolled towards us,
just reaching one of the wheels. I gave a yell.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" bellowed Simpson from behind the
barn.</p>

<p>"You're firing on the ambulance," I shouted.</p>

<p>He hurried up, followed leisurely by Thomas.</p>

<p>"I say," he said excitedly, "have I hurt him?"</p>

<p>"You have not even waked him. He has the special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
gift of&mdash;was it Wellington or Napoleon?&mdash;that of being
able to sleep through the heaviest battle."</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said Thomas. "Good old boy! What's
he been learning to-day?" he added, with godfatherly
interest.</p>

<p>"We're showing him life to-day. He has come to
see Simpson play golf."</p>

<p>"Doesn't he ever sit up?" asked Simpson, looking
at him with interest. "I don't see how he's going to
see anything if he's always on his back. Unless it were
something in the air."</p>

<p>"Don't you ever get the ball in the air?" said Myra
innocently.</p>

<p>"What will his Uncle Samuel show him if he does
sit up?" I asked. "Let's decide first if it's going to be
anything worth watching. Which hole are you for?
The third?"</p>

<p>"The eighth. My last shot had a bit of a slice."</p>

<p>"A slice! It had about the whole joint. I doubt,"
I said to Myra, "if we shall do much good here; let's
push on."</p>

<p>But Myra had put down the hood and taken some
of the clothes off Peter. Peter stirred slightly. He
seemed to know that something was going on. Then
suddenly he woke up, just in time to see Simpson miss
the ball completely. Instantly he gave a cry.</p>

<p>"Now you've done it," said Myra. "He's got to
go in. And I'm afraid he'll go away with quite a wrong
idea of the game."</p>

<p>But I was not thinking of the baby. Although I am
to be his uncle by marriage I had forgotten him.</p>

<p>"If that's about Simpson's form to-day," I said to
Myra, "you and I could still take them on and beat
them."</p>

<p>Myra looked up eagerly.</p>

<p>"What about Peter?" she asked; but she didn't
ask it very firmly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"We promised Dahlia to take him in directly he
cried," I said. "She'd be very upset if she thought
she couldn't trust us. And we've got to go in for our
clubs, anyway," I added.</p>

<p>Peter was sleeping peacefully again, but a promise
is a promise. After all, we had done a good deal for
his education that morning. We had shown him
human nature at work, and the position of golf in the
universe.</p>

<p>"We'll meet you on the first tee," said Myra to
Thomas.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="h3sm">VI.&mdash;HE SLEEPS</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">It's</span> sad to think that to-morrow we shall be in
London," said Simpson, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Rotten," agreed Thomas, and took another peach.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence.</p>

<p>"We shall miss you," I said, after careful thought.
I waited in vain for Dahlia to say something, and then
added, "You must both come again next year."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much."</p>

<p>"Not at all." I hate these awkward pauses. If my
host or hostess doesn't do anything to smooth them
over, I always dash in. "It's been delightful to have
you," I went on. "Are you sure you can't stay till
Wednesday?"</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," said Dahlia, "but you took me by
surprise. I had simply no idea. Are you really going?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so."</p>

<p>"Are <i>you</i> really staying?" said Archie to me.
"Help!"</p>

<p>"What about Peter?" asked Myra. "Isn't he too
young to be taken from his godfathers?"</p>

<p>"We've been talking that over," said Simpson, "and
I think it will be all right. We've mapped his future
out very carefully and we shall unfold it to you when
the coffee comes."</p>

<p>"Thomas is doing it with peach-stones," I said.
"Have another, and make him a sailor, Thomas," and
I passed the plate.</p>

<p>"Sailor indeed," said Dahlia. "He's going to be
a soldier."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's too late. Thomas has begun another one.
Well, he'll have to swallow the stone."</p>

<p>"A trifle hard on the Admiralty," said Archie. "It
loses both Thomas and Peter at one gulp. My country,
what of thee?"</p>

<p>However, when Thomas had peeled the peach, I
cleverly solved the difficulty by taking it on to my
plate while he was looking round for the sugar.</p>

<p>"No, no sugar, thanks," I said, and waved it away.</p>

<p>With the coffee and cigars Simpson unfolded his
scheme of education for Peter.</p>

<p>"In the first place," he said, "it is important that
even as a child he should always be addressed in
rational English and not in that ridiculous baby-talk
so common with young mothers."</p>

<p>"Oh dear," said Dahlia.</p>

<p>"My good Samuel," I broke in, "this comes well
from you. Why, only yesterday I heard you talking
to him. I think you called him his nunkey's ickle petsy
wetsy lambkin."</p>

<p>"You misunderstood me," said Simpson quickly.
"I was talking to <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh!" I said, rather taken aback. "Well&mdash;well,
I'm not." I lit a cigar. "And I shall be annoyed if
you call me so again."</p>

<p>"At the age of four," Simpson went on, "he shall
receive his first lesson in cricket. Thomas will bowl to
him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I suppose that means that Thomas will have to be
asked down here again," said Archie. "Bother! Still,
it's not for four years."</p>

<p>"Thomas will bowl to him, Archie will keep wicket,
and I shall field."</p>

<p>"And where do I come in?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You come in after Peter. Unless you would rather
have your lesson first."</p>

<p>"That's the second time I've been sat on," I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
said to Myra, "Why is Simpson so unkind to me
to-night?"</p>

<p>"I suppose he's jealous because you're staying on
another week."</p>

<p>"Probably; still, I don't like it. Could you turn
your back on him, do you think, to indicate our heavy
displeasure?"</p>

<p>Myra moved her chair round and rested her elbow
on the table.</p>

<p>"Go on, Samuel," said Dahlia. "You're lovely to-night.
I suppose these are Thomas's ideas as well as
your own?"</p>

<p>"His signature is duly appended to them."</p>

<p>"I didn't read 'em all," said Thomas.</p>

<p>"That's very rash of you," said Archie. "You
don't know what you mightn't let yourself in for. You
may have promised to pay the child threepence a week
pocket-money."</p>

<p>"No, there's nothing like that," said Simpson, to
Archie's evident disappointment. "Well, then, at the
age of ten he goes to a preparatory school."</p>

<p>"Has he learnt to read yet?" asked Dahlia. "I
didn't hear anything about it."</p>

<p>"He can read at six. I forgot to say that
I am giving him a book which I shall expect him
to read aloud to Thomas and me on his sixth
birthday."</p>

<p>"Thomas has got <i>another</i> invitation," said Archie.
"Dash it!"</p>

<p>"At fourteen he goes to a public school. The final
decision as to which public school he goes to will be
left to you, but, of course, we shall expect to be consulted
on the subject."</p>

<p>"I'll write and tell you what we decide on," said
Archie hastily; "there'll be no need for you to come
down and be told aloud."</p>

<p>"So far we have not arranged anything for him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
beyond the age of fourteen. I now propose to read out
a few general rules about his upbringing which we must
insist on being observed."</p>

<p>"The great question whether Simpson is kicked out
of the house to-night, or leaves unobtrusively by the
milk train to-morrow morning, is about to be settled,"
I murmured.</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Rule One.</span>&mdash;He must be brought up to be ambidextrous.'
It will be very useful," explained Simpson,
"when he fields cover for England."</p>

<p>"Or when he wants to shake hands with two people
at once," said Archie.</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Rule Two.</span>&mdash;He must be taught from the first
to speak French and German fluently.' He'll thank
you for that later on when he goes abroad."</p>

<p>"Or when he goes to the National Liberal Club,"
said Archie.</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Rule Three.</span>&mdash;He should be surrounded as far
as possible with beautiful things.' Beautiful toys,
beautiful wall-paper, beautiful scenery&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beautiful godfathers?" I asked doubtfully.</p>

<p>Simpson ignored me and went on hurriedly with the
rest of his rules.</p>

<p>"Well," said Archie, at the end of them, "they're
all fairly futile, but if you like to write them out
neatly and frame them in gold I don't mind
hanging them up in the bathroom. Has anybody
else got anything fatuous to say before the ladies
leave us?"</p>

<p>I filled my glass.</p>

<p>"I've really got a lot to say," I began, "because I
consider that I've been rather left out of things. If
you come to think of it, I'm the only person here who
isn't anything important, all the rest of you being godfathers,
or godmothers, or mothers, or fathers, or
something. However, I won't dwell on that now. But
there's one thing I must say, and here it is." I raised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
my glass. "Peter Blair Mannering, and may he grow
up to be a better man than any of us!"</p>

<p>Upstairs, in happy innocence of the tremendous task
in front of him, the child slept. Poor baby!</p>

<p>We drank solemnly, but without much hope.</p>

<h2>WINTER SPORT</h2>

<h3 class="h3sm">I.&mdash;AN INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"I had</span> better say at once," I announced as I
turned over the wine list, "that I have come
out here to enjoy myself, and enjoy myself I
shall. Myra, what shall we drink?"</p>

<p>"You had three weeks' honeymoon in October,"
complained Thomas, "and you're taking another three
weeks now. Don't you ever do any work?"</p>

<p>Myra and I smiled at each other. Coming from
Thomas, who spends his busy day leaning up against
the wireless installation at the Admiralty, the remark
amused us.</p>

<p>"We'll have champagne," said Myra, "because it's
our opening night. Archie, after you with the head-waiter."</p>

<p>It was due to Dahlia, really, that the Rabbits were
hibernating at the H&ocirc;tel des Ang&eacute;liques, Switzerland
(central-heated throughout); for she had been ordered
abroad, after an illness, to pull herself together a little,
and her doctor had agreed with Archie that she might
as well do it at a place where her husband could skate.
On the point that Peter should come and skate too,
however, Archie was firm. While admitting that he
loved his infant son, he reminded Dahlia that she
couldn't possibly get through Calais and Pontarlier
without declaring Peter, and that the duty on this
class of goods was remarkably heavy. Peter, therefore,
was left behind. He had an army of nurses to
look after him, and a stenographer to take down his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
more important remarks. With a daily bulletin and
a record of his table-talk promised her, Dahlia was
prepared to be content.</p>

<p>As for Myra and me, we might have hesitated to
take another holiday so soon, had it not been for a
letter I received one morning at breakfast.</p>

<p>"Simpson is going." I said. "He has purchased a
pair of skis."</p>

<p>"That does it," said Myra decisively. And, gurgling
happily to herself, she went out and bought a camera.</p>

<p>For Thomas I can find no excuses. At a moment of
crisis he left his country's Navy in jeopardy and, the
Admiralty yacht being otherwise engaged, booked a
first return from Cook's. And so it was that at four
o'clock one day we arrived together at the H&ocirc;tel des
Ang&eacute;liques, and some three hours later were settling
down comfortably to dinner.</p>

<p>"I've had a busy time," said Archie. "I've hired
a small bob, a luge and a pair of skis for myself, a pair
of snow-shoes and some skates for Dahlia, a&mdash;a tricycle
horse for Simpson, and I don't know what else. All in
French."</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the French for a pair of snow-shoes?"
asked Myra.</p>

<p>"I pointed to them in French. The undersized
Robert I got at a bargain. The man who hired it last
week broke his leg before his fortnight was up, and so
there was a reduction of several centimes."</p>

<p>"I've been busy too," I said. "I've been watching
Myra unpack, and telling her where not to put my
things."</p>

<p>"I packed jolly well&mdash;except for the accident."</p>

<p>"An accident to the boot-oil," I explained. "If I
get down to my last three shirts you will notice it."</p>

<p>We stopped eating for a moment in order to drink
Dahlia's health. It was Dahlia's health which had
sent us there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who's your friend, Samuel?" said Archie, as
Simpson caught somebody's eye at another table and
nodded.</p>

<p>"A fellow I met in the lift," said Simpson casually.</p>

<p>"Samuel, beware of elevator acquaintances," said
Myra in her most solemn manner.</p>

<p>"He's rather a good chap. He was at Peterhouse
with a friend of mine. He was telling me quite a good
story about a 'wine' my friend gave there once,
when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you tell him about your 'ginger-beers' at
Giggleswick?" I interrupted.</p>

<p>"My dear old chap, he's rather a man to be in with.
He knows the President."</p>

<p>"I thought nobody knew the President of the Swiss
Republic," said Myra. "Like the Man in the Iron
Mask."</p>

<p>"Not <i>that</i> President, Myra. The President of the
Ang&eacute;liques Sports Club."</p>

<p>"Never heard of it," we all said.</p>

<p>Simpson polished his glasses and prepared delightedly
to give an explanation.</p>

<p>"The Sports Club runs everything here," he began.
"It gives you prizes for fancy costumes and skating
and so on."</p>

<p>"Introduce me to the President at once," cooed
Myra, patting her hair and smoothing down her
frock.</p>

<p>"Even if you were the Treasurer's brother," said
Archie, "you wouldn't get a prize for skating, Simpson."</p>

<p>"You've never seen him do a rocking seventeen,
sideways."</p>

<p>Simpson looked at us pityingly.</p>

<p>"There's a lot more in it than that," he said. "The
President will introduce you to anybody. One might
see&mdash;er&mdash;somebody one rather liked the look of, and&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash; Well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
I mean in an hotel one wants to enter
into the hotel life and&mdash;er&mdash;meet other people."</p>

<p>"Who is she?" said Myra.</p>

<p>"Anybody you want to marry must be submitted
to Myra for approval first," I said. "We've told you
so several times."</p>

<p>Simpson hastily disclaimed any intention of marrying
anybody, and helped himself lavishly to champagne.</p>

<p>It so happened that I was the first of our party to
meet the President, an honour which, perhaps, I hardly
deserved. While Samuel was seeking tortuous introductions
to him through friends of Peterhouse friends
of his, the President and I fell into each other's arms
in the most natural way.</p>

<p>It occurred like this. There was a dance after dinner;
and Myra, not satisfied with my appearance, sent me
upstairs to put some gloves on. (It is one of the
penalties of marriage that one is always being sent
upstairs.) With my hands properly shod I returned
to the ball-room, and stood for a moment in a corner
while I looked about for her. Suddenly I heard a voice
at my side.</p>

<p>"Do you want a partner?" it said.</p>

<p>I turned, and knew that I was face to face with the
President.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"You are a new-comer, aren't you? I expect you
don't know many people. If there is anybody you
would like to dance with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I looked round the room. It was too good a chance
to miss.</p>

<p>"I wonder," I said. "That girl over there&mdash;in the
pink frock&mdash;just putting up her fan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He almost embraced me.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you on your taste," he said.
"Excellent! Come with me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>He went over to the girl in the pink dress, I at his
heels.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;may I introduce?" he said. "Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;yes,
this is Miss&mdash;er&mdash;yes. H'r'm." Evidently he
didn't know her name.</p>

<p>"Thank you," I said to him. He nodded and left
us. I turned to the girl in the pink frock. She was
very pretty.</p>

<p>"May I have this dance?" I asked. "I've got my
gloves on," I added.</p>

<p>She looked at me gravely, trying hard not to smile.</p>

<p>"You may," said Myra.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="h3sm">II.&mdash;THE OPENING RUN</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> a great effort Simpson strapped his foot securely
into a ski and turned doubtfully to Thomas.</p>

<p>"Thomas," he said, "how do you know which foot
is which?"</p>

<p>"It depends whose," said Thomas. He was busy
tying a large rucksack of lunch on to himself, and was
in no mood for Samuel's ball-room chatter.</p>

<p>"You've got one ski on one foot," I said. "Then
the other ski goes on the foot you've got over. I should
have thought you would have seen that."</p>

<p>"But I may have put the first one on wrong."</p>

<p>"You ought to know, after all these years, that you
are certain to have done so," I said severely. Having
had my own hired skis fixed on by the <i>concierge</i> I felt
rather superior. Simpson, having bought his in London,
was regarded darkly by that gentleman, and left to
his own devices.</p>

<p>"Are we all ready?" asked Myra, who had kept us
waiting for twenty minutes. "Archie, what about
Dahlia?"</p>

<p>"Dahlia will join us at lunch. She is expecting a
letter from Peter by the twelve o'clock post and refuses
to start without it. Also she doesn't think she is up
to ski-ing just yet. Also she wants to have a heart-to-heart
talk with the girl in red, and break it to her that
Thomas is engaged to several people in London
already."</p>

<p>"Come on," growled Thomas, and he led the way
up the hill. We followed him in single file.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a day of colour, straight from heaven. On
either side the dazzling whiteness of the snow; above,
the deep blue of the sky; in front of me the glorious
apricot of Simpson's winter suiting. London seemed
a hundred years away. It was impossible to work up
the least interest in the Home Rule Bill, the Billiard
Tournament, or the state of St. Paul's Cathedral.</p>

<p>"I feel extremely picturesque," said Archie. "If
only we had a wolf or two after us, the illusion would
be complete. The Boy Trappers, or Half-Hours among
the Rocky Mountains."</p>

<p>"It is a pleasant thought, Archie," I said, "that in
any wolf trouble the bachelors of the party would have
to sacrifice themselves for us. Myra dear, the loss of
Samuel in such circumstances would draw us very
close together. There might be a loss of Thomas too,
perhaps&mdash;for if there was not enough of Simpson to go
round, if there was a hungry wolf left over, would
Thomas hesitate?"</p>

<p>"No," said Thomas, "I should run like a hare."</p>

<p>Simpson said nothing. His face I could not see;
but his back looked exactly like the back of a man
who was trying to look as if he had been brought up
on skis from a baby and was now taking a small party
of enthusiastic novices out for their first lesson.</p>

<p>"What an awful shock it would be," I said, "if we
found that Samuel really did know something about
it after all; and, while we were tumbling about anyhow,
he sailed gracefully down the steepest slopes. I
should go straight back to Cricklewood."</p>

<p>"My dear chap, I've read a <i>lot</i> about it."</p>

<p>"Then we're quite safe."</p>

<p>"With all his faults," said Archie, "and they are
many&mdash;Samuel is a gentleman. He would never take
an unfair advantage of us. Hallo, here we are!"</p>

<p>We left the road and made our way across the snow
to a little wooden hut which Archie had noticed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
day before. Here we were to meet Dahlia for lunch;
and here, accordingly, we left the rucksack and such
garments as the heat of the sun suggested. Then, at
the top of a long snow-slope, steep at first, more gentle
later, we stood and wondered.</p>

<p>"Who's going first?" said Archie.</p>

<p>"What do you do?" asked Myra.</p>

<p>"You don't. It does it for you."</p>

<p>"But how do you stop?"</p>

<p>"Don't bother about that, dear," I said. "That
will be arranged for you all right. Take two steps to
the brink of the hill and pick yourself up at the bottom.
Now then, Simpson! Be a man. The lady waits,
Samuel. The&mdash;&mdash; Hallo! Hi! Help!" I cried, as I
began to move off slowly. It was too late to do anything
about it. "Good-bye," I called. And then
things moved more quickly....</p>

<p>Very quickly....</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a moment when I realized
that I wasn't keeping up with my feet....</p>

<p>I shouted to my skis to stop. It was no good. They
went on....</p>

<p>I decided to stop without them....</p>

<p>The ensuing second went by too swiftly for me to
understand rightly what happened. I fancy that,
rising from my sitting position and travelling easily on
my head, I caught my skis up again and passed
them....</p>

<p>Then it was their turn. They overtook me....</p>

<p>But I was not to be beaten. Once more I obtained
the lead. This time I took the inside berth, and kept
it....</p>

<p>There seemed to be a lot more snow than I really
wanted.... I struggled bravely with it....</p>

<p>And then the earthquake ceased, and suddenly I was
in the outer air. My first ski-run, the most glorious
run of modern times, was over.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ripping!" I shouted up the hill to them. "But
there's rather a nasty bump at the bottom," I added
kindly, as I set myself to the impossible business of
getting up....</p>

<p>"Jove," said Archie, coming to rest a few yards off,
"that's splendid!" He had fallen in a less striking way
than myself, and he got to his feet without difficulty.
"Why do you pose like that?" he asked, as he picked
up his stick.</p>

<p>"I'm a fixture," I announced. "Myra," I said, as she
turned a somersault and arrived beaming at my side,
"I'm here for some time; you'll have to come out
every morning with crumbs for me. In the afternoon
you can bring a cheering book and read aloud to your
husband. Sometimes I shall dictate little things to
you. They will not be my best little things; for this
position, with my feet so much higher than my head,
is not the one in which inspiration comes to me most
readily. The flow of blood to the brain impairs reflection.
But no matter."</p>

<p>"Are you really stuck?" asked Myra in some
anxiety. "I should hate to have a husband who lived
by himself in the snow," she said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Let us look on the bright side," said Archie. "The
snow will have melted by April, and he will then be
able to return to you. Hallo, here's Thomas! Thomas
will probably have some clever idea for restoring the
family credit."</p>

<p>Thomas got up in a businesslike manner and climbed
slowly back to us.</p>

<p>"Thomas," I said, "you see the position. Indeed,"
I added, "it is obvious. None of the people round me
seems inclined&mdash;or, it may be, able&mdash;to help. There
is a feeling that if Myra lives in the hotel alone while
I remain here&mdash;possibly till April&mdash;people will talk.
You know how ready they are. There is also the fact
that I have only hired the skis for three weeks. Also&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
minor point, but one that touches me rather&mdash;that I
shall want my hair cut long before March is out.
Thomas, imagine me to be a torpedo-destroyer on the
Maplin Sands, and tell me what on earth to do."</p>

<p>"Take your skis off."</p>

<p>"Oh, brilliant!" said Myra.</p>

<p>"Take my skis off?" I cried. "Never! Is it not
my duty to be the last to leave my skis? Can I abandon&mdash;&mdash; Hallo!
is that Dahlia on the sky-line?
Hooray, lunch! Archie, take my skis off, there's a
good fellow. We mustn't keep Dahlia waiting."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="h3sm">III.&mdash;A TYPICAL MORNING</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">You</span> take lunch out to-day&mdash;no?" said Josef, the
head-waiter, in his invariable formula.</p>

<p>Myra and I were alone at breakfast, the first down.
I was just putting some honey on to my seventh roll,
and was not really in the mood for light conversation
with Josef about lunch. By the way, I must say I
prefer the good old English breakfast. With eggs and
bacon and porridge you do know when you want to
stop; with rolls and honey you hardly notice what
you are doing, and there seems no reason why you
should not go on for ever. Indeed, once ... but you
would never believe me.</p>

<p>"We take lunch out to-day, <i>yes</i>, Josef. Lunch for&mdash;let
me see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Six?" suggested Myra.</p>

<p>"What are we all going to do? Archie said something
about skating. I'm off that."</p>

<p>"But whatever we do we must lunch, and it's much
nicer outdoors. Six, Josef."</p>

<p>Josef nodded and retired. I took my eighth roll.</p>

<p>"Do let's get off quickly to-day," I said. "There's
always so much chat in the morning before we start."</p>

<p>"I've just got one swift letter to write," said Myra,
as she got up, "and then I shall be pawing the ground."</p>

<p>Half an hour later I was in the lounge, booted, capped,
gloved, and putteed&mdash;the complete St. Bernard. The
lounge seemed to be entirely full of hot air and entirely
empty of anybody I knew. I asked for letters; and,
getting none, went out and looked at the thermometer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
To my surprise I discovered that there were thirty-seven
degrees of frost. A little alarmed, I tapped the thing
impatiently. "Come, come," I said, "this is not the
time for persiflage." However, it insisted on remaining
at five degrees below zero. What I should have done
about it I cannot say, but at that moment I remembered
that it was a Centigrade thermometer with the
freezing point in the wrong place. Slightly disappointed
that there were only five degrees of frost (Centigrade)
I returned to the lounge.</p>

<p>"Here you are at last," said Archie impatiently.
"What are we all going to do?"</p>

<p>"Where's Dahlia?" asked Myra. "Let's wait till
she comes and then we can all talk at once."</p>

<p>"Here she is. Dahlia, for Heaven's sake come and
tell us the arrangements for the day. Start with the
idea fixed in your mind that Myra and I have ordered
lunch for six."</p>

<p>Dahlia shepherded us to a quiet corner of the lounge
and we all sat down.</p>

<p>"By the way," said Simpson, "are there any letters
for me?"</p>

<p>"No; it's your turn to write," said Archie.</p>

<p>"But, my dear chap, there <i>must</i> be one, because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you never acknowledged the bed-socks," I
pointed out. "She can't write till you&mdash;&mdash; I mean,
it was rather forward of her to send them at all; and
if you haven't even&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," said Dahlia, "what does anybody want to
do?"</p>

<p>Thomas was the first to answer the question. A
girl in red came in from the breakfast-room and sat
down near us. She looked up in our direction and met
Thomas's eye.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Thomas, with a smile, and he
left us and moved across to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the girl he danced with all last night,"
whispered Myra. "I can't think what's come over
him. Is this our reserved Thomas&mdash;Thomas the
taciturn, whom we know and love so well? I don't
like the way she does her hair."</p>

<p>"She's a Miss Aylwyn," said Simpson in a loud
voice. "I had one dance with her myself."</p>

<p>"The world," said Archie, "is full of people with
whom Samuel has had one dance."</p>

<p>"Well, that washes Thomas out, anyway. He'll
spend the day teaching her something. What are the
rest of us going to do?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence.</p>

<p>"Oh, Archie," said Dahlia, "did you get those
nails put in my boots?"</p>

<p>I looked at Myra ... and sighed.</p>

<p>"Sorry, dear," he said. "I'll take them down now.
The man will do them in twenty minutes." He walked
over to the lift at the same moment that Thomas
returned to us.</p>

<p>"I say," began Thomas, a little awkwardly, "if
you're arranging what to do, don't bother about me.
I rather thought of&mdash;er&mdash;taking it quietly this morning.
I think I overdid it a bit yesterday."</p>

<p>"We warned you at the time about the fourth
hard-boiled egg," I said.</p>

<p>"I meant the ski-ing. We thought of&mdash;I thought
of having lunch in the hotel, but, of course, you can
have my rucksack to carry yours in. Er&mdash;I'll go and
put it in for you."</p>

<p>He disappeared rather sheepishly in the direction
of the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Now, Samuel," said Myra gently.</p>

<p>"Now what, Myra?"</p>

<p>"It's your turn. If you have a headache, tell us
her name."</p>

<p>"My dear Myra, I want to ski to-day. Where shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
we go? Let's go to the old slopes and practise the
Christiania Turn."</p>

<p>"What you want to practise is the ordinary Hampstead
Straight," I said. "A medium performance of
yours yesterday, Samuel."</p>

<p>"But, my dear old chap," he said eagerly, "I told
you it was the fault of my skis. They would stick to
the snow. Oh, I say," he added, "that reminds me.
I must go and buy some wax for them."</p>

<p>He dashed off. I looked at Myra ... and sighed.</p>

<p>"The nail-man won't be long," said Archie to
Dahlia, on his return. "I'm to call for them in a
quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>"Can't you wear some other boots, Dahlia, or your
bedroom slippers or something? It's half-past eleven.
We really must get off soon."</p>

<p>"But we haven't settled where we're going yet."</p>

<p>"Then for 'eving's sake let's do it. Myra and I
thought we might go up above the wood at the back
and explore. We can always ski down. It might be
rather exciting."</p>

<p>"Remember," said Dahlia, "I'm not so expert as
you are."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Myra, "we're the Oberland mixed
champions."</p>

<p>"You know," said Archie, "I was talking to the
man who's doing Dahlia's boots and he said the snow
would be bad for ski-ing to-day."</p>

<p>"If he talked in French, no doubt you misunderstood
him," I said, a little annoyed. "He was probably
asking you to buy a pair of skates."</p>

<p>"Talking about that," said Archie, "why shouldn't
we skate this morning, and have lunch at the hotel, and
then get the bob out this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Here you are," said Thomas, coming up with a
heavy rucksack. "Lunch for six, so you'll have an
extra one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd forgotten about lunch," said Archie. "Look
here, just talk it over with Dahlia while I go and see
about my skates. I don't suppose Josef will mind if
we do stay in to lunch after all. What about Simpson?"</p>

<p>I looked at Myra ... and sighed.</p>

<p>"What about him?" I said.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>Half an hour later two exhausted people&mdash;one of
them with lunch for six on his back&mdash;began the ascent
to the wood, trailing their skis behind them.</p>

<p>"Another moment," said Myra, "and I should have
screamed."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="h3sm">IV.&mdash;THOMAS, AND A TURN</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Myra</span> finished her orange, dried her hands daintily on
my handkerchief, and spoke her mind.</p>

<p>"This is the third time," she said, "that Thomas
has given us the slip. If he gets engaged to that girl
in red I shall cry."</p>

<p>"There are," I said, idly throwing a crust at Simpson
and missing him, "engagements and Swiss engagements&mdash;just
as there are measles and German measles.
It is well known that Swiss engagements don't
count."</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> got engaged in Kent. A bit of luck."</p>

<p>"I have nothing against Miss Aylwyn&mdash;&mdash;" I
went on.</p>

<p>"Except the way she does her hair."</p>

<p>"&mdash;but she doesn't strike me as being the essential
Rabbit. We cannot admit her to the&mdash;er&mdash;fold."</p>

<p>"The covey," suggested Myra.</p>

<p>"The warren. Anyhow, she&mdash;&mdash; Simpson, for
goodness' sake stop fooling about with your bearded
friend and tell us what you think of it all."</p>

<p>We were finishing lunch in the lee of a little chalet,
high above the hotel, and Simpson had picked up an
acquaintance with a goat, which he was apparently
trying to conciliate with a piece of chocolate. The
goat, however, seemed to want a piece of Simpson.</p>

<p>"My dear old chap, he won't go away. Here&mdash;shoo!
shoo! I wish I knew what his name was."</p>

<p>"Ernest," said Myra.</p>

<p>"I can't think why you ever got into such a hirsute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
set, Simpson. He probably wants your compass.
Give it to him and let him withdraw."</p>

<p>Ernest, having decided that Simpson was not worth
knowing, withdrew, and we resumed our conversation.</p>

<p>"When we elderly married folk have retired," I
went on, "and you gay young bachelors sit up over a
last cigar to discuss your conquests, has not Thomas
unbent to you, Samuel, and told you of his hopes and
fears?"</p>

<p>"He told me last night he was afraid he was going
bald, and he said he hoped he wasn't."</p>

<p>"That's a bad sign," said Myra. "What did you
say?"</p>

<p>"I said I thought he was."</p>

<p>With some difficulty I got up from my seat in the
snow and buckled on my skis.</p>

<p>"Come on, let's forget Thomas for a bit. Samuel
is now going to show us the Christiania Turn."</p>

<p>Simpson, all eagerness, began to prepare himself.</p>

<p>"I said I would, didn't I? I was doing it quite well
yesterday. This is a perfect little slope for it. You
understand the theory of it, don't you?"</p>

<p>"We hope to after the exhibition."</p>

<p>"Well, the great thing is to lean the opposite way
to the way you think you ought to lean. That's
what's so difficult."</p>

<p>"You understand, Myra? Samuel will lean the
opposite way to what he thinks he ought to lean. Tell
Ernest."</p>

<p>"But suppose you think you ought to lean the
<i>proper</i> way, the way they do in Christiania," said
Myra, "and you lean the opposite way, then what
happens?"</p>

<p>"That is what Samuel will probably show us," I
said.</p>

<p>Simpson was now ready.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am going to turn to the left," he said. "Watch
carefully. Of course, I may not bring it off the first
time."</p>

<p>"I can't help thinking you will," said Myra.</p>

<p>"It depends what you call bringing it off," I said.
"We have every hope of&mdash;I mean we don't think our
money will be wasted. Have you got the opera-glasses
and the peppermints and the programme,
darling? Then you may begin, Samuel."</p>

<p>Simpson started down the slope a little unsteadily.
For one moment I feared that there might be an accident
before the real accident, but he recovered himself
nobly and sped to the bottom. Then a cloud of snow
shot up, and for quite a long time there was no
Simpson.</p>

<p>"I knew he wouldn't disappoint us," gurgled
Myra.</p>

<p>We slid down to him and helped him up.</p>

<p>"You see the idea," he said. "I'm afraid I spoilt
it a little at that end, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Samuel, you improved it out of all knowledge."</p>

<p>"But that actually <i>is</i> the Christiania Turn."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>why</i> don't we live in Christiania?" exclaimed
Myra to me. "Couldn't we possibly afford it?"</p>

<p>"It must be a happy town," I agreed. "How the
old streets must ring and ring again with jovial
laughter."</p>

<p>"Shall I do it once more?"</p>

<p>"<i>Can</i> you?" said Myra, clasping her hands eagerly.</p>

<p>"Wait here," said Samuel, "and I'll do it quite
close to you."</p>

<p>Myra unstrapped her camera.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, with several excellent films of the
scene of the catastrophe, we started for home. It was
more than a little steep, but the run down was accomplished
without any serious trouble. Simpson went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
first to discover any hidden ditches (and to his credit
be it said that he invariably discovered them); Myra,
in the position of safety in the middle, profited by
Samuel's frequent object-lessons; while I, at the back,
was ready to help Myra up, if need arose, or to repel
any avalanche which descended on us from above.
On the level snow at the bottom we became more
companionable.</p>

<p>"We still haven't settled the great Thomas question,"
said Myra. "What about to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Why bother about to-morrow? <i>Carpe diem.</i>
Latin."</p>

<p>"But the great tailing expedition is for to-morrow.
The horses are ordered; everything is prepared. Only
one thing remains to settle. Shall we have with us a
grumpy but Aylwynless Thomas, or shall we let him
bring her and spoil the party?"</p>

<p>"She can't spoil the party. I'm here to enjoy
myself, and all Thomas's <i>fianc&eacute;es</i> can't stop me. Let's
have Thomas happy, anyway."</p>

<p>"She's really quite a nice girl," said Simpson. "I
danced with her once."</p>

<p>"Right-o, then. I'll tell Dahlia to invite her."</p>

<p>We hurried on to the hotel; but as we passed the
rink the President stopped me for a chat. He wanted
me to recite at a concert that evening. Basely deserted
by Myra and Samuel, I told him that I did not recite;
and I took the opportunity of adding that personally
I didn't think anybody else ought to. I had just
persuaded him to my point of view when I noticed
Thomas cutting remarkable figures on the ice. He
picked himself up and skated to the side.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he said. "Had a good day?"</p>

<p>"Splendid. What have you been doing?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;skating."</p>

<p>"I say, about this tailing expedition to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Er&mdash;yes, I was just going to talk about that."</p>

<p>"Well, it's all right. Myra is getting Dahlia to ask
her to come with us."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Thomas, brightening up.</p>

<p>"You see, we shall only be seven, even with Miss
Aylwyn, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss <i>Aylwyn</i>?" said Thomas in a hollow voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't that the name of your friend in red?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>that</i> one. Oh, but that's quite&mdash;I mean," he
went on hurriedly, "Miss Aylwyn is probably booked
up for to-morrow. It's Miss Cardew who is so keen on
tailing. That girl in green, you know."</p>

<p>For a moment I stared at him blankly. Then I left
him and dashed after Myra.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="h3sm">V.&mdash;A TAILING PARTY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> procession prepared to start in the following
order:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) A brace of sinister-looking horses.</p>

<p>(2) Gaspard, the Last of the Bandits; or "Why
cause a lot of talk by pushing your rich uncle over the
cliff, when you can have him stabbed quietly for one
franc fifty?" (If ever I were in any vendetta business
I should pick Gaspard first.)</p>

<p>(3) A sleigh full of lunch.</p>

<p>(4) A few well-known ladies and gentlemen (being
the cream of the H&ocirc;tel des Ang&eacute;liques) on luges;
namely, reading from left to right (which is really the
best method&mdash;unless you are translating Hebrew),
Simpson, Archie, Dahlia, Myra, me, Miss Cardew, and
Thomas.</p>

<p>While Gaspard was putting the finishing knots to
the luges, I addressed a few remarks to Miss Cardew,
fearing that she might be feeling a little lonely amongst
us. I said that it was a lovely day, and did she think
the snow would hold off till evening? Also had she
ever done this sort of thing before? I forget what her
answers were.</p>

<p>Thomas meanwhile was exchanging badinage on the
hotel steps with Miss Aylwyn. There must be something
peculiar in the Swiss air, for in England Thomas
is quite a respectable man ... and a godfather.</p>

<p>"I suppose we <i>have</i> asked the right one," said Myra
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"His young affections are divided. There was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
third girl in pink with whom he breakfasted a lot this
morning. It is the old tradition of the sea, you know.
A sailor&mdash;I mean an Admiralty civilian has a wife at
every wireless station."</p>

<p>"Take your seats, please," said Archie. "The
horses are sick of waiting."</p>

<p>We sat down. Archie took Dahlia's feet on his lap,
Myra took mine, Miss Cardew took Thomas's. Simpson,
alone in front, nursed a guide-book.</p>

<p>"<i>En avant!</i>" cried Simpson in his best French-taught-in-twelve-lessons
accent.</p>

<p>Gaspard muttered an oath to his animals. They
pulled bravely. The rope snapped&mdash;and they trotted
gaily down the hill with Gaspard.</p>

<p>We hurried after them with the luges....</p>

<p>"It's a good joke," said Archie, after this had
happened three times, "but, personally, I weary of it.
Miss Cardew, I'm afraid we've brought you out under
false pretences. Thomas didn't explain the thing to
you adequately. He gave you to understand that
there was more in it than this."</p>

<p>Gaspard, who seemed full of rope, produced a fourth
piece and tied a knot that made even Simpson
envious.</p>

<p>"Now, Samuel," I begged, "do keep the line taut
this time. Why do you suppose we put your apricot
suit right in the front? Is it, do you suppose, for the
sunset effects at eleven o'clock in the morning, or is
it that you may look after the rope properly?"</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry, Miss Cardew," said Simpson,
feeling that somebody ought to apologize for something
and knowing that Gaspard wouldn't, "but I
expect it will be all right now."</p>

<p>We settled down again. Once more Gaspard cursed
his horses, and once more they started off bravely.
And this time we went with them.</p>

<p>"The idea all along," I explained to Miss Cardew.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"I rather suspected it," she said. Apparently she
has a suspicious mind.</p>

<p>After the little descent at the start, we went uphill
slowly for a couple of miles, and then more rapidly
over the level. We had driven over the same road in
a sleigh, coming from the station, and had been bitterly
cold and extremely bored. Why our present position
should be so much more enjoyable I didn't quite
see.</p>

<p>"It's the expectation of an accident," said Archie.
"At any moment somebody may fall off. Good."</p>

<p>"My dear old chap," said Simpson, turning round
to take part in the conversation, "why anybody <i>should</i>
fall off&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>We went suddenly round a corner, and quietly and
without any fuss whatever Simpson left his luge and
rolled on to the track. Luckily any possibility of a
further accident was at once avoided. There was no
panic at all. Archie kicked the body temporarily out
of the way; after which Dahlia leant over and pushed
it thoughtfully to the side of the road. Myra warded
it off with a leg as she neared it; with both hands I
helped it into the deep snow from which it had shown
a tendency to emerge; Miss Cardew put a foot out at
it for safety; and Thomas patted it gently on the
head as the end of the "tail" went past....</p>

<p>As soon as we had recovered our powers of speech&mdash;all
except Miss Cardew, who was in hysterics&mdash;we called
upon Gaspard to stop. He indicated with the back of
his neck that it would be dangerous to stop just then;
and it was not until we were at the bottom of the hill,
nearly a mile from the place where Simpson left us,
that the procession halted, and gave itself up again to
laughter.</p>

<p>"I hope he is not hurt," said Dahlia, wiping the
tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't spoil a good joke like that by getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
hurt," said Myra confidently. "He's much too much
of a sportsman."</p>

<p>"Why did he do it?" said Thomas.</p>

<p>"He suddenly remembered he hadn't packed his
safety-razor. He's half-way back to the hotel by now."</p>

<p>Miss Cardew remained in hysterics.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later a brilliant sunset was observed
approaching from the north. A little later it was seen
to be a large dish of apricots and cream.</p>

<p>"He draws near," said Archie. "Now then, let's
be stern with him."</p>

<p>At twenty yards' range Simpson began to talk. His
trot had heated him slightly.</p>

<p>"I say," he said excitedly. "You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Myra shook her head at him.</p>

<p>"Not done, Samuel," she said reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Not what, Myra? What not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You oughtn't to leave us like that without telling
us."</p>

<p>"After all," said Archie, "we are all one party, and
we are supposed to keep together. If you prefer to go
about by yourself, that's all right; but if we go to the
trouble of arranging something for the whole party&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You might have caused a very nasty accident,"
I pointed out. "If you were in a hurry, you had only
to say a word to Gaspard and he would have stopped
for you to alight. Now I begin to understand why you
kept cutting the rope at the start."</p>

<p>"You have sent Miss Cardew into hysterics by your
conduct," said Dahlia.</p>

<p>Miss Cardew gave another peal. Simpson looked at
her in dismay.</p>

<p>"I say, Miss Cardew, I'm most awfully sorry. I
really didn't&mdash;&mdash; I say, Dahlia," he went on confidentially,
"oughtn't we to do something about this?
Rub her feet with snow or&mdash;I mean, I know there's
<i>something</i> you do when people have hysterics. It's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
rather serious if they go on. Don't you burn feathers
under their nose?" He began to feel in his pockets.
"I wonder if Gaspard's got a feather?"</p>

<p>With a great effort Miss Cardew pulled herself
together. "It's all right, thank you," she said in a
stifled voice.</p>

<p>"Then let's get on," said Archie.</p>

<p>We resumed our seats once more. Archie took
Dahlia's feet on his lap. Myra took mine. Miss Cardew
took Thomas's. Simpson clung tight to his luge with
both hands.</p>

<p>"Right!" cried Archie.</p>

<p>Gaspard swore at his horses. They pulled bravely.
The rope snapped&mdash;and they trotted gaily up the hill
with Gaspard.</p>

<p>We hurried after them with the luges....</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="h3sm">VI.&mdash;A HAPPY ENDING</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">For</span> our last night they might at least have had a
dance," said Myra, "even if there was no public
presentation."</p>

<p>"As we had hoped," I admitted.</p>

<p>"What is a gymkhana, anyway?" asked Thomas.</p>

<p>"A few little competitions," said Archie. "One
must cater for the chaperons sometimes. You are all
entered for the Hat-making and the Feather-blowing&mdash;Dahlia
thought it would amuse you."</p>

<p>"At Cambridge," I said reminiscently, "I once blew
the feather 119 feet 7 inches. Unfortunately I stepped
outside the circle. My official record is 2 feet."</p>

<p>"Did you ever trim a hat at Cambridge?" asked
Myra. "Because you've got to do one for me to-night."</p>

<p>I had not expected this. My view of the competition
had been that <i>I</i> should have to provide the face and
that <i>she</i> would have to invent some suitable frame
for it.</p>

<p>"I'm full of ideas," I lied.</p>

<p>Nine o'clock found a small row of us prepared to
blow the feather. The presidential instructions were
that we had to race our feather across a chalk-line at
the end of the room, anybody touching his feather to
be disqualified.</p>

<p>"In the air or on the floor?" asked Simpson
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Just as you like," said the President kindly, and
came round with the bag.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>I selected Percy with care&mdash;a dear little feather
about half an inch long and of a delicate whity-brown
colour. I should have known him again anywhere.</p>

<p>"Go!" said the President. I was rather excited,
with the result that my first blow was much too
powerful for Percy. He shot up to the ceiling and,
in spite of all I could do, seemed inclined to stay there.
Anxiously I waited below with my mouth open; he
came slowly down at last; and in my eagerness I
played my second just a shade too soon. It missed
him. My third (when I was ready for it) went harmlessly
over his head. A frantic fourth and fifth helped
him downwards ... and in another moment my
beautiful Percy was on the floor. I dropped on my
knees and played my sixth vigorously. He swirled to
the left; I was after him like a shot ... and crashed
into Thomas. We rolled over in a heap.</p>

<p>"Sorry!" we apologized as we got back on to our
hands and knees.</p>

<p>Thomas went on blowing.</p>

<p>"Where's my feather?" I said.</p>

<p>Thomas was now two yards ahead, blowing like
anything. A terrible suspicion darted through my
mind.</p>

<p>"Thomas," I said, "you've got my feather."</p>

<p>He made no answer. I scrambled after him.</p>

<p>"That's Percy," I said. "I should know him anywhere.
You're blowing Percy. It's very bad form to
blow another man's feather. If it got about, you would
be cut by the county. Give me back my feather,
Thomas."</p>

<p>"How do you know it's your feather?" he said
truculently. "Feathers are just alike."</p>

<p>"How do I know?" I asked in amazement. "A
feather that I've brought up from the egg? Of course
I know Percy." I leant down to him. "<i>P&mdash;percy</i>,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
I whispered. He darted forward a good six inches.
"You see," I said, "he knows his name."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," said Thomas, "his name's
<i>P&mdash;paul</i>. Look, I'll show you."</p>

<p>"You needn't bother, Thomas," I said hastily.
"This is mere trifling. I <i>know</i> that's my feather. I
remember his profile distinctly."</p>

<p>"Then where's mine?"</p>

<p>"How do I know? You may have swallowed it.
Go away and leave Percy and me to ourselves. You're
only spoiling the knees of your trousers by staying
here."</p>

<p>"Paul and I&mdash;&mdash;" began Thomas.</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a burst of applause. Dahlia
had cajoled her feather over the line first. Thomas
rose and brushed himself. "You can 'ave him," he
said.</p>

<p>"There!" I said, as I picked Percy up and placed
him reverently in my waistcoat pocket. "That shows
that he was mine. If he had been your own little Paul
you would have loved him even in defeat. Oh, musical
chairs now? Right-o." And at the President's touch
I retired from the arena.</p>

<p>We had not entered for musical chairs. Personally
I should have liked to, but it was felt that, if none of
us did, then it would be more easy to stop Simpson
doing so. For at musical chairs Simpson is&mdash;I am
afraid there is only one word for it; it is a word that
I hesitate to use, but the truth must prevail&mdash;Simpson
is <i>rough</i>. He <i>lets himself go</i>. He plays <i>all he knows</i>.
Whenever I take Simpson out anywhere I always
whisper to my hostess, <small>"<i>Not</i> musical chairs."</small></p>

<p>The last event of the evening was the hat-making
competition. Each man of us was provided with five
large sheets of coloured crinkly paper, a packet of pins,
a pair of scissors, and a lady opposite to him.</p>

<p>"Have you any plans at all?" asked Myra.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Heaps. Tell me, what sort of hat would you like?
Something for the Park?" I doubled up a piece of
blue paper and looked at it. "You know, if this is
a success, Myra, I shall often make your hats for
you."</p>

<p>Five minutes later I had what I believe is called a
"foundation." Anyhow, it was something for Myra
to put her head into.</p>

<p>"Our very latest Bond Street model," said Myra.
"Only fifteen guineas&mdash;or three-and-ninepence if you
buy it at our other establishment in Battersea."</p>

<p>"Now then, I can get going," I said, and I began to
cut out a white feather. "Yes, your ladyship, this is
from the genuine bird on our own ostrich farm in the
Fulham Road. Plucked while the ingenuous biped had
its head in the sand. I shall put that round the brim,"
and I pinned it round.</p>

<p>"What about a few roses?" said Myra, fingering
the red paper.</p>

<p>"The roses are going there on the right." I pinned
them on. "And a humming-bird and some violets
next to them.... I say, I've got a lot of paper over.
What about a nice piece of cabbage ... there ...
and a bunch of asparagus ... and some tomatoes
and a seagull's wing on the left. The back still looks
rather bare&mdash;let's have some poppies."</p>

<p>"There's only three minutes more," said Myra,
"and you haven't used all the paper yet."</p>

<p>"I've got about one William Allan Richardson and
a couple of canaries over," I said, after examining my
stock. "Let's put it inside as lining. There, Myra,
my dear, I'm proud of you. I always say that in a
nice quiet hat nobody looks prettier than you."</p>

<p>"Time!" said the President.</p>

<p>Anxious matrons prowled round us.</p>

<p>"We don't know any of the judges," I whispered.
"This isn't fair."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The matrons conferred with the President. He
cleared his throat. "The first prize," he said, "goes
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But I had swooned.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>"Well," said Archie, "the Rabbits return to England
with two cups won on the snowfields of Switzerland."</p>

<p>"Nobody need know," said Myra, "<i>which</i> winter-sport
they were won at."</p>

<p>"Unless I have 'Ski-ing, First Prize' engraved on
mine," I said, "as I had rather intended."</p>

<p>"Then I shall have 'Figure-Skating' on mine,"
said Dahlia.</p>

<p>"Two cups," reflected Archie, "and Thomas
engaged to three charming girls. I think it has been
worth it, you know."</p>

<p>He came into my life in the following way.</p>

<p>Some months ago I wanted to buy some silk stockings;
not for myself, for I seldom wear them, but for
a sister. The idea came suddenly to me that any
woman with a brother and a birthday would simply
love the one to give her silk stockings for the other.
But, of course, they would have to be the right silk
stockings&mdash;the fashionable shape for the year, the
correct assortment of clocks, and so forth. Then as to
material&mdash;could I be sure I was getting silk, and not
silkette or something inferior? How maddening if,
seeing that I was an unprotected man, they palmed off
Jaeger on me! Clearly this was a case for outside
assistance. So I called in Celia.</p>

<p>"This," I said to her, "is practically the only subject
on which I am not an expert. At the same time
I have a distinct feeling for silk stockings. If you can
hurry me past all the embarrassing counters safely, and
arrange for the lady behind the right one to show me
the right line in silken hose, I will undertake to pick out
half a dozen pairs that would melt any sister's heart."</p>

<p>Well, the affair went off perfectly. Celia took the
matter into her own hands and behaved just as if I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
were buying them for <i>her</i>. The shop-assistant also
behaved as if I were. Fortunately I kept my head
when it came to giving the name and address. "No,"
I said firmly to Celia. "Not yours; my sister's."
And I dragged her away to tea.</p>

<p>Now whether it was because Celia had particularly
enjoyed her afternoon; or because she felt that a man
who was as ignorant as I about silk stockings must
lead a very lonely life; or because I had mentioned
casually and erroneously that it was my own birthday
that week, I cannot say; but on the following morning
I received a little box, with a note on the outside which
said in her handwriting, "Something for you. Be kind
to him." And I opened it and found Sidney.</p>

<p>He was a Japanese dwarf-tree&mdash;the merest boy. At
eighty or ninety, according to the photographs, he
would be a stalwart fellow with thick bark on his trunk,
and fir-cones or acorns (or whatever was his speciality)
hanging all over him. Just at present he was barely
ten. I had only eighty years to wait before he reached
his prime.</p>

<p>Naturally I decided to lavish all my care upon his
upbringing. I would water him after breakfast every
morning, and (when I remembered it) at night. If there
was any top-dressing he particularly fancied, he should
have it. If he had any dead leaves to snip off, I would
snip them.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that I discovered something
else in the box&mdash;a card of instructions. I have not got
it now, and I have forgotten the actual wording, but
the spirit of it was this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hints on the Proper Rearing and Bringing-up
Of a Japanese Dwarf-tree</span></p>

<p>The life of this tree is a precarious one, and if it is to
be successfully brought to manhood the following rules
must be carefully observed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>I. This tree requires, above all else, fresh air and
exercise.</p>

<p>II. Whenever the sun is shining, the tree should be
placed outside, in a position where it can absorb the
rays.</p>

<p>III. Whenever the rain is raining, it should be placed
outside, in a position where it can absorb the wet.</p>

<p>IV. It should be taken out for a trot at least once
every day.</p>

<p>V. It simply loathes artificial light and artificial heat.
If you keep it in your drawing-room, see that it is
situated as far as possible from the chandelier and the
gas-stove.</p>

<p>VI. It also detests noise. Do not place it on the top
of the pianola.</p>

<p>VII. It loves moonlight. Leave it outside when you
go to bed, in case the moon should come out.</p>

<p>VIII. On the other hand, it hates lightning. Cover
it up with the canary's cloth when the lightning begins.</p>

<p>IX. If it shows signs of drooping, a course of massage
will generally bring it round.</p>

<p>X. But in no case offer it buns.</p></div>

<p>Well, I read these instructions carefully, and saw at
once that I should have to hand over the business of
rearing Sidney to another. I have my living to earn
the same as anybody else, and I should never get any
work done at all if I had constantly to be rushing home
from the office on the plea that it was time for Master
Sidney's sun-bath.</p>

<p>So I called up my housekeeper, and placed the
matter before her.</p>

<p>I said: "Let me introduce you to Sidney. He is
very dear to me; dearer to me than a&mdash;a brother. No,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
on second thoughts my brother is perhaps&mdash;well, anyhow,
Sidney is very dear to me. I will show my trust
in you by asking you to tend him for me. Here are a
few notes about his health. Frankly he is delicate.
But the doctors have hope. With care, they think, he
may live to be a hundred-and-fifty. His future is in
your hands."</p>

<p>My housekeeper thanked me for this mark of esteem
and took the card of instructions away with her. I
asked her for it a week afterwards and it appeared
that, having committed the rules to memory, she had
lost it. But that she follows the instructions I have
no doubt; and certainly she and Sidney understand
each other's ways exactly. Automatically she gives
him his bath, his massage, his run in the park. When
it rains or snows or shines, she knows exactly what to
do with Sidney.</p>

<p>But as a consequence I see little of him. I suppose
it must always be so; we parents must make these
sacrifices for our children. Think of a mother only seeing
her eldest-born for fifteen weeks a year through the
long period of his schooling; and think of me, doomed
to catch only the most casual glimpses of Sidney until
he is ninety.</p>

<p>For, you know, I might almost say that I never see
him at all now. As I go to my work I may, if I am
lucky, get a fleeting glance of him on the tiles, where
he sits drinking in the rain or sun. In the evening,
when I return, he is either out in the moonlight or, if
indoors, shunning the artificial light with the cloth
over his head. Indeed, the only times when I really
see him to talk to are when Celia comes to tea with me.
Then my housekeeper hurries him in from his walk or
his sun-bath, and puts him, brushed and manicured,
on my desk; and Celia and I whisper fond nothings
to him. I believe Celia thinks he lives there!</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>As I began by saying, I weep for Sidney's approaching
end. For my housekeeper leaves this week. A
new one takes her place. How will she treat my poor
Sidney? The old card of instructions is lost; what
can I give her in its place? The legend that Sidney's
is a precious life&mdash;that he must have his morning bath,
his run, his glass of hot water after meals! She would
laugh at it. Besides, she may not be at all the sort of
foster-mother for a Japanese dwarf-tree....</p>

<p>It will break my heart if Sidney dies now, for I had
so looked forward to celebrating his ninetieth birthday
with him. It will hurt Celia too. But <i>her</i> grief, of
course, will be an inferior affair. In fact, a couple of
pairs of silk stockings will help her to forget him
altogether.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_FINANCIER_I" id="THE_FINANCIER_I"></a>THE FINANCIER. I</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">This</span> is how I became a West African mining
magnate with a stake in the Empire.</p>

<p>During February I grew suddenly tired of
waiting for the summer to begin. London in the
summer is a pleasant place, and chiefly so because you
can keep on buying evening papers to see what Kent
is doing. In February life has no such excitements
to offer. So I wrote to my solicitor about it.</p>

<p>"I want you" (I wrote) "to buy me fifty rubber
shares, so that I can watch them go up and down."
And I added "Brokerage 1/8" to show that I knew
what I was talking about.</p>

<p>He replied tersely as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool. If you have any money to invest
I can get you a safe mortgage at five per cent. Let me
know."</p>

<p>It's a funny thing how the minds of solicitors run
upon mortgages. If they would only stop to think for
a moment they would see that you couldn't possibly
watch a safe mortgage go up and down. I left my
solicitor alone and consulted Henry on the subject.
In the intervals between golf and golf Henry dabbles
in finance.</p>

<p>"You don't want anything gilt-edged, I gather?"
he said. It's wonderful how they talk.</p>

<p>"I want it to go up and down," I explained patiently,
and I indicated the required movement with my
umbrella.</p>

<p>"What about a little flutter in oil?" he went on,
just like a financier in a novel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll have a little flutter in raspberry jam if you like.
Anything as long as I can rush every night for the last
edition of the evening papers and say now and then,
'Good heavens, I'm ruined.'"</p>

<p>"Then you'd better try a gold-mine," said
Henry bitterly, in the voice of one who had tried.
"Take your choice," and he threw the paper over
to me.</p>

<p>"I don't want a whole mine&mdash;only a vein or two.
Yes, this is very interesting," I went on, as I got among
the West Africans. "The scoring seems to be pretty
low; I suppose it must have been a wet wicket. 'H.E.
Reef, 1-3/4, 2'&mdash;he did a little better in the second
innings. '1/2, Boffin River, 5/16, 7/16'&mdash;they followed on,
you see, but they saved the innings defeat. By the
way, which figure do I really keep my eye on when I
want to watch them go up and down?"</p>

<p>"Both. One eye on each. And don't talk about
Boffin River to me."</p>

<p>"Is it like that, Henry? I am sorry. I suppose it's
too late now to offer you a safe mortgage at five per
cent? I know a man who has some. Well, perhaps
you're right."</p>

<p>On the next day I became a magnate. The Jaguar
Mine was the one I fixed upon&mdash;for two reasons. First,
the figure immediately after it was 1, which struck me
as a good point from which to watch it go up and down.
Secondly, I met a man at lunch who knew somebody
who had actually seen the Jaguar Mine.</p>

<p>"He says that there's no doubt about there being
lots there."</p>

<p>"Lots of what? Jaguars or gold?"</p>

<p>"Ah, he didn't say. Perhaps he meant jaguars."</p>

<p>Anyhow, it was an even chance, and I decided to
risk it. In a week's time I was the owner of what we
call in the City a "block" of Jaguars&mdash;bought from
one Herbert Bellingham, who, I suppose, had been got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
at by his solicitor and compelled to return to something
safe. I was a West African magnate.</p>

<p>My first two months as a magnate were a great
success. With my heart in my mouth I would tear
open the financial editions of the evening papers, to find
one day that Jaguars had soared like a rocket to 1-1/16,
the next that they had dropped like a stone to 1-1/32.
There was one terrible afternoon when for some reason
which will never be properly explained we sank to 15/16.
I think the European situation had something to do
with it, though this naturally is not admitted. Lord
Rothschild, I fancy, suddenly threw all his Jaguars on
the market; he sold and sold and sold, and only held
his hand when, in desperation, the Tsar granted the
concession for his new Southend to Siberia railway.
Something like that. But he never recked how the
private investor would suffer; and there was I, sitting
at home and sending out madly for all the papers, until
my rooms were littered with copies of <i>The Times</i>, <i>The
Financial News</i>, <i>Answers</i>, <i>The Feathered World</i>, and
<i>Home Chat</i>. Next day we were up to 31/32, and I was
able to breathe again.</p>

<p>But I had other pleasures than these. Previously I
had regarded the City with awe, but now I felt a glow
of possession come over me whenever I approached it.
Often in those first two months I used to lean against
the Mansion House in a familiar sort of way; once I
struck a match against the Royal Exchange. And
what an impression of financial acumen I could make
in a drawing-room by a careless reference to my
"block of Jaguars"! Even those who misunderstood
me and thought I spoke of my "flock of jaguars" were
startled. Indeed life was very good just then.</p>

<p>But lately things have not been going well. At the
beginning of April Jaguars settled down at 1-1/16. Though
I stood for hours at the club tape, my hair standing up
on end and my eyeballs starting from their sockets,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Jaguars still came through steadily at 1-1/16. To give
them a chance of doing something, I left them alone
for a whole week&mdash;with what agony you can imagine.
Then I looked again; a whole week and anything
might have happened. Pauper or millionaire?&mdash;No,
still 1-1/16.</p>

<p>Worse was to follow. Editors actually took to
leaving out Jaguars altogether. I suppose they were
sick of putting 1-1/16 in every edition. But how ridiculous
it made my idea seem of watching them go up and
down! How blank life became again!</p>

<p>And now what I dreaded most of all has happened.
I have received a "Progress Report" from the mine.
It gives the "total footage" for the month, special
reference being made to "cross-cutting, winzing, and
sinking." The amount of "tons crushed" is announced.
There is serious talk of "ore" being "extracted";
indeed there has already been a most alarming "yield
in fine gold." In short, it can no longer be hushed up
that the property may at any moment be "placed on
a dividend-paying basis."</p>

<p>Probably I shall be getting a safe five per cent!</p>

<p>"Dash it all," as I said to my solicitor this morning,
"I might just as well have bought a rotten mortgage."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>
<h4>THE FINANCIER. II</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Eighteen months later</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is nearly two years ago that I began speculating
in West African mines. You may remember what
a stir my entry into the financial world created; how
Sir Isaac Isaacstein went mad and shot himself; how
Sir Samuel Samuelstein went mad and shot his typist;
and how Sir Moses Mosestein went mad and shot his
typewriter, permanently damaging the letter "s."
There was panic in the City on that February day in
1912 when I bought Jaguars and set the market
rocking.</p>

<p>I bought Jaguars partly for the rise and partly for
the thrill. In describing my speculation to you eighteen
months ago I dwelt chiefly on the thrill part; I alleged
that I wanted to see them go up and down. It would
have been more accurate to have said that I wanted to
see them go up. It was because I was sure they were
going up that, with the united support of my solicitor,
my stockbroker, my land agent, my doctor, my architect
and my vicar (most of them hired for the occasion), I
bought fifty shares in the Jaguar mine of West Africa.</p>

<p>When I bought Jaguars they were at 1&mdash;1-1/16. This
means that&mdash;&mdash; No, on second thoughts I won't.
There was a time when, in the pride of my new knowledge,
I should have insisted on explaining to you what
it meant, but I am getting <i>blas&eacute;</i> now; besides, you
probably know. It is enough that I bought them, and
bought them on the distinct understanding from my
financial adviser that by the end of the month they
would be up to 2. In that case I should have made
rather more than forty pounds in a few days, simply
by assembling together my solicitor, stockbroker, land-agent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
etc., etc., in London, and without going to West
Africa at all. A wonderful thought.</p>

<p>At the end of a month Jaguars were steady at 1-1/16;
and I had received a report from the mine to the effect
that down below they were simply hacking gold out
as fast as they could hack, and up at the top were very
busy rinsing and washing and sponging and drying it.
The next month the situation was the same: Jaguars
in London very steady at 1-1/16, Jaguar diggers in West
Africa very steady at gold-digging. And at the end of
the third month I realized not only that I was not
going to have any thrills at all, but (even worse) that
I was not going to make any money at all. I had been
deceived.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>That was where, eighteen months ago, I left the
story of my City life. A good deal has happened since
then; as a result of which I am once more eagerly
watching the price of Jaguars.</p>

<p>A month or two after I had written about them,
Jaguars began to go down. They did it (as they have
done everything since I have known them) stupidly.
If they had dropped in a single night to 3/4, I should at
least have had my thrill. I should have suffered in a
single night the loss of some pounds, and I could have
borne it dramatically; either with the sternness of the
silent Saxon, or else with the volubility of the volatile&mdash;I
can't think of anybody beginning with a "V." But,
alas! Jaguars never dropped at all. They subsided.
They subsided slowly back to 1&mdash;so slowly that you
could hardly observe them going. A week later they
were 63/64, which, of course, is practically the same as 1.
A month afterwards they were 31/32, and it is a debatable
point whether that is less or more than 63/64. Anyhow,
by the time I had worked it out and decided that it was
slightly less, they were at 61/64, and one had the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
trouble all over again. At 61/64 I left them for a time;
and when I next read the financial column they were
at 15/16, which still seemed to be fairly near to 1. And
even when at last, after many months, I found them
down to 7/8 I was not seriously alarmed, but felt that it
was due to some little local trouble (as that the manager
had fallen down the main shaft and was preventing the
gold being shot out properly), and that, when the
obstruction had been removed, Jaguars would go up
to 1 again.</p>

<p>But they didn't. They continued to subside. When
they had subsided to 1/2 I woke up. My dream of financial
glory was over. I had lost my money and my
faith in the City; well, let them go. With an effort
I washed Jaguars out of my mind. Henceforward they
were nothing to me.</p>

<p>And then, months after, Andrew came on the scene.
At lunch one day he happened to mention that he had
been talking to his broker.</p>

<p>"Do you often talk to your broker?" I asked in
admiration. It sounded so magnificent.</p>

<p>"Often."</p>

<p>"I haven't got a broker to talk to. When you next
chat to yours, I wish you'd lead the conversation round
to Jaguars and see what he says."</p>

<p>"Why, have you got some?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but they're no good. Have a cigarette, won't
you?"</p>

<p>Next morning to my amazement I got a telegram
from Andrew. "Can get you ten shillings for Jaguars.
Wire if you will sell, and how many."</p>

<p>It was really a shock to me. When I had asked
Andrew to mention Jaguars to his broker it was solely
in the hope of hearing some humorous City comment
on their futility&mdash;one of those crisp jests for which the
Stock Exchange is famous. I had no idea that his
broker might like to buy them from me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>I wired back: "Sell fifty, quick."</p>

<p>Next day he told me he had sold them.</p>

<p>"That's all right," I said cheerfully; "they're his.
He can watch them go up and down. When do I get
my twenty-five pounds?" To save twenty-five pounds
from the wreck was wonderful.</p>

<p>"Not for a month; and, of course, you don't deliver
the shares till then."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, 'deliver the shares'?" I
asked in alarm. "I haven't got the gold-mine here;
it's in Africa or somewhere. Must I go out and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you've got a certificate for them."</p>

<p>My heart sank.</p>

<p>"Have I?" I whispered. "Good Lord, I wonder
where it is."</p>

<p>I went home and looked. I looked for two days; I
searched drawers and desks and letter-books and safes
and ice-tanks and trouser-presses&mdash;every place in
which a certificate might hide. It was no good. I
went back to Andrew. I was calm.</p>

<p>"About these Jaguars," I said casually. "I don't
quite understand my position. What have I promised
to do? And can they put me in prison if I don't do it?"</p>

<p>"You've promised to sell fifty Jaguars to a man
called Stevens by the middle of next month. That's
all."</p>

<p>"I see," I said, and I went home again.</p>

<p>And I suppose you see too. I've got to sell fifty
Jaguars to a man called Stevens by the middle of next
month. Although I really have fifty fully matured
ones of my own, there's nothing to prove it, and they
are so suspicious in the City that they will never take
my bare word. So I shall have to buy fifty new Jaguars
for this man called Stevens&mdash;and buy them by the
middle of next month.</p>

<p>And this is why I am still eagerly watching the price
of Jaguars. Yesterday they were 5/8. I am hoping that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
by the middle of next month they will be down to 1/2
again. But I find it difficult to remember sometimes
which way I want them to go. This afternoon, for
instance, when I saw they had risen to 11/16 I was quite
excited for a moment; I went out and bought some
cigars on the strength of it. Then I remembered; and
I came home and almost decided to sell the pianola.
It is very confusing. You must see how very confusing
it is.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DOUBLE" id="THE_DOUBLE"></a>THE DOUBLE</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I was</span> having lunch in one of those places where
you stand and eat sandwiches until you are tired,
and then try to count up how many you have had.
As the charm of these sandwiches is that they all taste
exactly alike, it is difficult to recall each individual as
it went down; one feels, too, after the last sandwich,
that one's mind would more willingly dwell upon other
matters. Personally I detest the whole business&mdash;the
place, the sandwiches, the method of scoring&mdash;but it is
convenient and quick, and I cannot keep away. On
this afternoon I was giving the <i>foie gras</i> plate a turn.
I know a man who will never touch <i>foie gras</i> because of
the cruelty involved in the preparation of it. I excuse
myself on the ground that my own sufferings in eating
these sandwiches are much greater than those of any
goose in providing them.</p>

<p>There was a grey-haired man in the corner who kept
looking at me. I seemed to myself to be behaving with
sufficient propriety, and there was nothing in my
clothes or appearance to invite comment; for in the
working quarter of London a high standard of beauty
is not insisted upon. On the next occasion when I
caught his eye I frowned at him, and a moment later I
found myself trying to stare him down. After two
minutes it was I who retired in confusion to my glass.</p>

<p>As I prepared to go&mdash;for to be watched at meals
makes me nervous, and leads me sometimes to eat the
card with "Foie Gras" on it in mistake for the sandwich&mdash;he
came up to me and raised his hat.</p>

<p>"You must excuse me, sir, for staring at you," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
said, "but has any one ever told you that you are
exactly like A. E. Barrett?"</p>

<p>I drew myself up and rested my left hand lightly on
my hip. I thought he said David Garrick.</p>

<p>"The very image of him," he went on, "when first
I met him."</p>

<p>Something told me that in spite of his grey hair he
was not talking of David Garrick after all.</p>

<p>"Like <i>who?</i>" I said in some disappointment.</p>

<p>"A. E. Barrett."</p>

<p>I tried to think of a reply, both graceful and witty.
The only one I could think of was, "Oh?"</p>

<p>"It's extraordinary. If your hair were just a little
longer the likeness would be perfect."</p>

<p>I thought of offering to go away now and come back
in a month's time. Anyway, it would be an excuse for
going now.</p>

<p>"I first knew him at Cambridge," he explained.
"We were up together in the 'seventies."</p>

<p>"Ah, I was up in the nineteen hundreds," I said.
"I just missed you both."</p>

<p>"Well, didn't they ever tell you at Cambridge that
you were the image of A. E. Barrett?"</p>

<p>I tried to think. They had told me lots of things at
Cambridge, but I couldn't remember any talk about
A. E. Barrett.</p>

<p>"I should have thought every one would have
noticed it," he said.</p>

<p>I had something graceful for him this time all right.</p>

<p>"Probably," I said, "those who were unfortunate
enough to know me had not the honour of knowing
A. E. Barrett."</p>

<p>"But everybody knew A. E. Barrett. <i>You've</i> heard
of him, of course?"</p>

<p>The dreadful moment had arrived. I knew it would.</p>

<p>"Of course," I said.</p>

<p>"A charming fellow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very brainy," I agreed.</p>

<p>"Well, just ask any of your artist friends if they
don't notice the likeness. The nose, the eyes, the
expression&mdash;wonderful! But I must be going. Perhaps
I shall see you here again some day. Good afternoon";
and he raised his hat and left me.</p>

<p>You can understand that I was considerably disturbed.
First, why had I never heard of A. E. Barrett?
Secondly, what sort of looking fellow was he? Thirdly,
with all this talk about A. E. Barrett, however many
sandwiches had I eaten? The last question seemed
the most impossible to answer, so I said "eight," to be
on the safe side, and went back to work.</p>

<p>In the evening I called upon Peter. My acquaintance
of the afternoon had assumed too readily that I should
allow myself to be on friendly terms with artists; but
Peter's wife illustrates books, and they both talk in a
disparaging way of our greatest Academicians.</p>

<p>"Who," I began at once, as I shook hands, "did I
remind you of as I came in at the door?"</p>

<p>Peter was silent. Mrs. Peter, feeling that some answer
was called for, said, "The cat."</p>

<p>"No, no. Now I'll come in again." I went out and
returned dramatically. "Now then, tell me frankly,
doesn't that remind you of A. E. Barrett entering his
studio?"</p>

<p>"Who is A. E. Barrett?"</p>

<p>I was amazed at their ignorance.</p>

<p>"He's the well-known artist. <i>Surely</i> you've heard
of him?"</p>

<p>"I seem to know the name," lied Peter. "What
did he paint?"</p>

<p>"'Sunrise on the Alps,' 'A Corner of the West,'
'The Long Day Wanes'&mdash;<i>I</i> don't know. Something.
The usual thing."</p>

<p>"And are you supposed to be like him?"</p>

<p>"I am. Particularly when eating sandwiches."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it worth while getting you some, in order to
observe the likeness?" asked Mrs. Peter.</p>

<p>"If you've never seen A. E. Barrett I fear you'd
miss the likeness, even in the most favourable circumstances.
Anyhow, you must have heard of him&mdash;dear
old A. E.!"</p>

<p>They were utterly ignorant of him, so I sat down
and told them what I knew; which, put shortly, was
that he was a very remarkable-looking fellow.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>I have not been to the sandwich-place since. Detesting
the sandwiches as I do, I find A. E. Barrett a good
excuse for keeping away. For, upon the day after
that when he came into my life, I had a sudden cold
fear that the thing was a plant. How, in what way, I
cannot imagine. That I am to be sold a <i>Guide to Cambridge</i>
at the next meeting; that an A. E. Barrett
hair-restorer is about to be placed on the market;
that an offer will be made to enlarge my photograph
(or Barrett's) free of charge if I buy the frame&mdash;no, I
cannot think what it can be.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, why should it be a plant? We Barretts
are not the sort of men to be mixed up with fraud.
Impetuous the Barrett type may be, obstinate, jealous&mdash;so
much you see in our features. But dishonest?
Never!</p>

<p>Still, as I did honestly detest those last eight sandwiches,
I shall stay away.</p>

<h3><a name="A_BREATH_OF_LIFE" id="A_BREATH_OF_LIFE"></a>A BREATH OF LIFE</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">This</span> is the story of a comedy which nearly
became a tragedy. In its way it is rather a
pathetic story.</p>

<p>The comedy was called <i>The Wooing of Winifred</i>. It
was written by an author whose name I forget; produced
by the well-known and (as his press-agent has
often told us) popular actor-manager, Mr. Levinski;
and played by (among others) that very charming
young man, Prosper Vane&mdash;known locally as Alfred
Briggs until he took to the stage. Prosper played the
young hero, <i>Dick Seaton</i>, who was actually wooing
<i>Winifred</i>. Mr. Levinski himself took the part of a
middle-aged man of the world with a slight <i>embonpoint</i>;
down in the programme as <i>Sir Geoffrey Throssell</i>
but fortunately still Mr. Levinski. His opening words,
as he came on, were, "Ah, Dick, I have a note for you
somewhere," which gave the audience an interval in
which to welcome him, while he felt in all his pockets
for the letter. One can bow quite easily while feeling
in one's pockets, and it is much more natural than
stopping in the middle of an important speech in order
to acknowledge any cheers. The realization of this,
by a dramatist, is what is called "stagecraft." In this
case the audience could tell at once that the "technique"
of the author (whose name unfortunately I
forget) was going to be all right.</p>

<p>But perhaps I had better describe the whole play
as shortly as possible. The theme&mdash;as one guessed
from the title, even before the curtain rose&mdash;was the
wooing of <i>Winifred</i>. In the First Act <i>Dick</i> proposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to <i>Winifred</i> and was refused by her, not from lack of
love, but for fear lest she might spoil his career, he
being one of those big-hearted men with a hip-pocket
to whom the open spaces of the world call loudly;
whereupon Mr. Levinski took <i>Winifred</i> on one side
and told the audience how, when <i>he</i> had been a young
man, some good woman had refused <i>him</i> for a similar
reason and had been miserable ever since. Accordingly
in the Second Act <i>Winifred</i> withdrew her refusal and
offered to marry <i>Dick</i>, who declined to take advantage
of her offer for fear that she was willing to marry him
from pity rather than from love; whereupon Mr.
Levinski took <i>Dick</i> on one side and told the audience
how, when <i>he</i> had been a young man, he had refused to
marry some good woman (a different one) for a similar
reason, and had been broken-hearted ever afterwards.
In the Third Act it really seemed as though they were
coming together at last; for at the beginning of it
Mr. Levinski took them both aside and told the audience
a parable about a butterfly and a snap-dragon, which
was both pretty and helpful, and caused several middle-aged
ladies in the first and second rows of the upper
circle to say, "What a nice man Mr. Levinski must be
at home, dear!"&mdash;the purport of the allegory being
to show that both <i>Dick</i> and <i>Winifred</i> were being very
silly, as indeed by this time everybody but the author
was aware. Unfortunately at that moment a footman
entered with a telegram for <i>Miss Winifred</i>, which
announced that she had been left fifty thousand pounds
by a dead uncle in Australia; and, although Mr.
Levinski seized this fresh opportunity to tell the audience
how in similar circumstances Pride, to his lasting
remorse, had kept <i>him</i> and some good woman (a third
one) apart, nevertheless <i>Dick</i> held back once more, for
fear lest he should be thought to be marrying her for her
money. The curtain comes down as he says, "Good-bye
... good ber-eye." But there is a Fourth Act,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and in the Fourth Act Mr. Levinski has a splendid time.
He tells the audience two parables&mdash;one about a dahlia
and a sheep, which I couldn't quite follow&mdash;and three
reminiscences of life in India; he brings together finally
and for ever these hesitating lovers; and, best of all,
he has a magnificent love-scene of his own with a pretty
widow, in which we see, for the first time in the play,
how love should really be made&mdash;not boy-and-girl
pretty-pretty love, but the deep emotion felt (and with
occasional lapses of memory explained) by a middle-aged
man with a slight <i>embonpoint</i> who has knocked
about the world a bit and knows life. Mr. Levinski, I
need not say, was at his best in this Act.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>I met Prosper Vane at the club some ten days before
the first night, and asked him how rehearsals were
going.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," he said. "But it's a rotten play.
I've got such a dashed silly part."</p>

<p>"From what you told me," I said, "it sounded
rather good."</p>

<p>"It's so dashed unnatural. For three whole acts
this girl and I are in love with each other, and we know
we're in love with each other, and yet we simply fool
about. She's a dashed pretty girl, too, my boy. In
real life I'd jolly soon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Alfred," I protested, "you're not going
to fall in love with the girl you have to fall in love
with on the stage? I thought actors never did
that."</p>

<p>"They do sometimes; it's a dashed good advertisement.
Anyway, it's a silly part, and I'm fed up with
it."</p>

<p>"Yes, but do be reasonable. If <i>Dick</i> got engaged
at once to <i>Winifred</i> what would happen to Levinski?
He'd have nothing to do."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Prosper Vane grunted. As he seemed disinclined
for further conversation I left him.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>The opening night came, and the usual distinguished
and fashionable audience (including myself), such as
habitually attends Mr. Levinski's first nights, settled
down to enjoy itself. Two acts went well. At the end
of each Mr. Levinski came before the curtain and bowed
to us, and we had the honour of clapping him loud and
long. Then the Third Act began....</p>

<p>Now this is how the Third Act ends:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><i>Exit</i> Sir Geoffrey.</p>

<p><i>Winifred (breaking the silence).</i> Dick, you heard
what he said. Don't let this silly money come between
us. I have told you I love you, dear. Won't you&mdash;won't
you speak to me?</p>

<p><i>Dick.</i> Winifred, I&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He gets up and walks round
the room, his brow knotted, his right fist occasionally
striking his left palm. Finally he comes to a stand in
front of her.</i>) Winifred, I&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He raises his arms
slowly at right angles to his body and lets them fall heavily
down again.</i>) I can't. (<i>In a low, hoarse voice</i>) I&mdash;can't!
(<i>He stands for a moment with bent head; then with a
jerk he pulls himself together.</i>) Good-bye! (<i>His hands
go out to her, but he draws them back as if frightened to
touch her. Nobly</i>) Good ber-eye.</p>

<p class="adpad">[<i>He squares his shoulders and stands looking at the
audience with his chin in the air; then with a
shrug of utter despair, which would bring tears
into the eyes of any young thing in the pit, he turns
and with bent head walks slowly out.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Curtain.</span></p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>That <i>is</i> how the Third Act ends. I went to the dress
rehearsal, and so I know.</p>

<p>How the accident happened I do not know. I suppose
Prosper was nervous; I am sure he was very
much in love. Anyhow, this is how, on that famous
first night, the Third Act ended:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><i>Exit</i> Sir Geoffrey.</p>

<p><i>Winifred</i> (<i>breaking the silence</i>). Dick, you heard
what he said. Don't let this silly money come between
us. I have told you I love you, dear. Won't you&mdash;won't
you speak to me?</p>

<p><i>Dick</i> (<i>jumping up</i>). Winifred, I&mdash;&mdash; (<i>with a great
gulp</i>) I LOVE YOU!!!</p></div>

<p>Whereupon he picked her up in his arms and carried
her triumphantly off the stage ... and after a little
natural hesitation the curtain came down.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>Behind the scenes all was consternation. Mr.
Levinski (absolutely furious) had a hasty consultation
with the author (also furious), in the course of which
they both saw that the Fourth Act as written was now
an impossibility. Poor Prosper, who had almost immediately
recovered his sanity, tremblingly suggested
that Mr. Levinski should announce that, owing to the
sudden illness of Mr. Vane, the Fourth Act could not
be given. Mr. Levinski was kind enough to consider
this suggestion not entirely stupid; his own idea
having been (very regretfully) to leave out the two
parables and three reminiscences from India and concentrate
on the love-scene with the widow.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said. "Your plan is better. I will
say you are ill. It is true; you are mad. To-morrow
we will play it as it was written."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can't," said the author gloomily. "The
critics won't come till the Fourth Act, and they'll
assume that the Third Act ended as it did to-night.
The Fourth Act will seem all nonsense to them."</p>

<p>"True. And I was so good, so much myself, in that
Act." He turned to Prosper. "You&mdash;fool!"</p>

<p>"Or there's another way," began the author. "We
might&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then a gentleman in the gallery settled it from
the front of the curtain. There was nothing in the
programme to show that the play was in four acts.
"The Time is the present day and the Scene is in
Sir Geoffrey Throssell's town-house," was all it said.
And the gentleman in the gallery, thinking it was all
over, and being pleased with the play and particularly
with the realism of the last moment of it, shouted
"<i>Author!</i>" And suddenly everybody else cried
"<i>Author! Author!</i>" The play was ended.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>I said that this was the story of a comedy which
nearly became a tragedy. But it turned out to be no
tragedy at all. In the three acts to which Prosper
Vane had condemned it the play appealed to both
critics and public; for the Fourth Act (as he recognised
so clearly) was unnecessary, and would have spoilt the
balance of it entirely. Best of all, the shortening of
the play demanded that some entertainment should be
provided in front of it, and this enabled Mr. Levinski
to introduce to the public Professor Wollabollacolla
and Princess Collabollawolla, the famous exponents of
the Bongo-Bongo, that fascinating Central African war
dance which was soon to be the rage of society. But
though, as a result, the takings of the Box Office surpassed
all Mr. Levinski's previous records, our friend
Prosper Vane received no practical acknowledgment
of his services. He had to be content with the hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and heart of the lady who played <i>Winifred</i>, and the
fact that Mr. Levinski was good enough to attend the
wedding. There was, in fact, a photograph in all the
papers of Mr. Levinski doing it.</p>

<h3><a name="UNDER_ENTIRELY_NEW" id="UNDER_ENTIRELY_NEW"></a>"UNDER ENTIRELY NEW MANAGEMENT"</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I know</span> a fool of a dog who pretends that he is
a Cocker Spaniel, and is convinced that the world
revolves round him wonderingly. The sun rises
so it may shine on his glossy morning coat; it sets so
his master may know that it is time for the evening
biscuit; if the rain falls it is that a fool of a dog may
wipe on his mistress's skirt his muddy boots. His day
is always exciting, always full of the same good things;
his night a repetition of his day, more gloriously
developed. If there be a sacred moment before the
dawn when he lies awake and ponders on life, he tells
himself confidently that it will go on for ever like this&mdash;a
life planned nobly for himself, but one in which
the master and mistress whom he protects must always
find a place. And I think perhaps he would want a
place for me, too, in that life, who am not his real
master but yet one of the house. I hope he would.</p>

<p>What Chum doesn't know is this: his master and
mistress are leaving him. They are going to a part of
the world where a fool of a dog with no manners is a
nuisance. If Chum could see all the good little London
dogs, who at home sit languidly on their mistress's lap,
and abroad take their view of life through a muff much
bigger than themselves; if he could see the big obedient
dogs who walk solemnly through the Park carrying
their master's stick, never pausing in their impressive
march unless it be to plunge into the Serpentine and
rescue a drowning child, he would know what I mean.
He would admit that a dog who cannot answer to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
own name and pays but little more attention to "Down,
idiot," and "Come here, fool," is not every place's dog.
He would admit it, if he had time. But before I could
have called his attention to half the good dogs I had
marked out he would have sat down beaming in front
of a motor-car ... and then he would never have
known what now he will know so soon&mdash;that his master
and mistress are leaving him.</p>

<p>It has been my business to find a new home for him.
This is harder than you think. I can make him sound
lovable, but I cannot make him sound good. Of course,
I might leave out his doubtful qualities, and describe
him merely as beautiful and affectionate; I might ... but
I couldn't. I think Chum's habitual smile would
get larger, he would wriggle the end of himself more
ecstatically than ever if he heard himself summed up
as beautiful and affectionate. Anyway, I couldn't do
it, for I get carried away when I speak of him and I
reveal all his bad qualities.</p>

<p>"I am afraid he is a snob," I confessed to one woman
of whom I had hopes. "He doesn't much care for
what he calls the lower classes."</p>

<p>"Oh?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, he hates badly dressed people. Corduroy
trousers tied up at the knee always excite him. I don't
know if any of your family&mdash;no, I suppose not. But
if he ever sees a man with his trousers tied up at the
knee he goes for him. And he can't bear tradespeople;
at least not the men. Washerwomen he loves. He
rather likes the washing-basket too. Once, when he
was left alone with it for a moment, he appeared shortly
afterwards on the lawn with a pair of&mdash;well, I mean he
had no business with them at all. We got them away
after a bit of a chase, and then they had to go to the
wash again. It seemed rather a pity when they'd only
just come back. Of course, I smacked his head for
him; but he looks so surprised and reproachful when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
he's done wrong that you never feel it's quite his
fault."</p>

<p>"I doubt if I shall be able to take him after all,"
she said. "I've just remembered&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I forget what it was she remembered, but it meant
that I was still without a new home for Chum.</p>

<p>"What does he eat?" somebody else asked me.
It seemed hopeful; I could see Chum already installed.</p>

<p>"Officially," I said, "he lives on puppy biscuits;
he also has the toast-crusts after breakfast and an
occasional bone. Privately, he is fond of bees. I have
seen him eat as many as six bees in an afternoon.
Sometimes he wanders down to the kitchen-garden
and picks the gooseberries; he likes all fruit, but gooseberries
are the things he can reach best. When there
aren't any gooseberries about he has to be content with
the hips and haws from the rose-trees. But really you
needn't bother, he can eat anything. The only thing
he doesn't like is whitening. We were just going to
mark the lawn one day, and while we were busy pegging
it out he wandered up and drank the whitening out of
the marker. It is practically the only disappointment
he has ever had. He looked at us, and you could see
that his opinion of us had gone down. 'What did you
<i>put</i> it there for, if you didn't mean me to drink it?'
he said reproachfully. Then he turned and walked
slowly and thoughtfully back to his kennel. He never
came out till next morning."</p>

<p>"Really?" said my man. "Well, I shall have to
think about it. I'll let you know."</p>

<p>Of course, I knew what he meant.</p>

<p>With a third dog-lover to whom I spoke the negotiations
came to grief, not apparently because of any
fault of Chum's, but because, if you will believe it,
of my shortcomings. At least I can suppose
nothing else. For this man had been enthusiastic
about him. He had revelled in the tale of Chum's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
wickedness; he had adored him for being so conceited.
He had practically said that he would take him.</p>

<p>"Do," I begged. "I'm sure he'd be happy with
you. You see, he's not everybody's dog; I mean, I
don't want any odd man whom I don't know to take
him. It must be a friend of mine, so that I shall often
be able to see Chum afterwards."</p>

<p>"So that&mdash;what?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"So that I shall often be able to see Chum afterwards.
Week-ends, you know, and so on. I couldn't bear to
lose the silly old ass altogether."</p>

<p>He looked thoughtful; and, when I went on to
speak about Chum's fondness for chickens, and his
other lovable ways, he changed the subject altogether.
He wrote afterwards that he was sorry he couldn't
manage with a third dog. And I like to think he was
not afraid of Chum&mdash;but only of me.</p>

<p>But I have found the right man at last. A day will
come soon when I shall take Chum from his present
home to his new one. That will be a great day for him.
I can see him in the train, wiping his boots effusively
on every new passenger, wriggling under the seat and
out again from sheer joy of life; I can see him in the
taxi, taking his one brief impression of a world that
means nothing to him; I can see him in another train,
joyous, eager, putting his paws on my collar from time
to time and saying excitedly, "<i>What</i> a day this is!"
And if he survives the journey; if I can keep him on
the way from all the delightful deaths he longs to try;
if I can get him safely to his new house, then I can see
him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, I wonder. What will they do to him? When
I see him again, will he be a sober little dog, answering
to his name, careful to keep his muddy feet off the
visitor's trousers, grown up, obedient, following to heel
round the garden, the faithful servant of his master?
Or will he be the same old silly ass, no use to anybody,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
always dirty, always smiling, always in the way, a
clumsy, blundering fool of a dog who knows you can't
help loving him? I wonder....</p>

<p>Between ourselves, I don't think they <i>can</i> alter him
now.... Oh, I hope they can't.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="A_FAREWELL_TOUR" id="A_FAREWELL_TOUR"></a>A FAREWELL TOUR</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">This</span> is positively Chum's last appearance in
print&mdash;for his own sake no less than for yours.
He is conceited enough as it is, but if once he
got to know that people are always writing about him
in books his swagger would be unbearable. However,
I have said good-bye to him now; I have no longer
any rights in him. Yesterday I saw him off to his new
home, and when we meet again it will be on a different
footing. "Is that your dog?" I shall say to his master.
"What is he? A Cocker? Jolly little fellows, aren't
they? I had one myself once."</p>

<p>As Chum refused to do the journey across London
by himself, I met him at Liverpool Street. He came
up in a crate; the world must have seemed very small
to him on the way. "Hallo, old ass," I said to him
through the bars, and in the little space they gave him
he wriggled his body with delight. "Thank Heaven
there's <i>one</i> of 'em alive," he said.</p>

<p>"I think this is my dog," I said to the guard, and I
told him my name.</p>

<p>He asked for my card.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I haven't one with me," I explained.
When policemen touch me on the shoulder and ask me
to go quietly; when I drag old gentlemen from underneath
motor-'buses, and they decide to adopt me on
the spot; on all the important occasions when one
really wants a card, I never have one with me.</p>

<p>"Can't give him up without proof of identity," said
the guard, and Chum grinned at the idea of being
thought so valuable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>I felt in my pockets for letters. There was only one,
but it offered to lend me &pound;10,000 on my note of hand
alone. It was addressed to "Dear Sir," and though I
pointed out to the guard that I was the "Sir," he still
kept tight hold of Chum. Strange that one man should
be prepared to trust me with &pound;10,000, and another
should be so chary of confiding to me a small black
spaniel.</p>

<p>"Tell the gentleman who I am," I said imploringly
through the bars. "Show him you know me."</p>

<p>"He's <i>really</i> all right," said Chum, looking at the
guard with his great honest brown eyes. "He's been
with us for years."</p>

<p>And then I had an inspiration. I turned down the
inside pocket of my coat; and there, stitched into it,
was the label of my tailor with my name written on
it. I had often wondered why tailors did this; obviously
they know how stupid guards can be.</p>

<p>"I suppose that's all right," said the guard reluctantly.
Of course, I might have stolen the coat. I see
his point.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you wouldn't like a nice packing-case for
yourself?" I said timidly. "You see, I thought I'd
put Chum on the lead. I've got to take him to Paddington,
and he must be tired of his shell by now. It
isn't as if he were <i>really</i> an armadillo."</p>

<p>The guard thought he would like a shilling and a
nice packing-case. Wood, he agreed, was always
wood, particularly in winter, but there were times
when you were not ready for it.</p>

<p>"How are you taking him?" he asked, getting to
work with a chisel. "Underground?"</p>

<p>"Underground?" I cried in horror. "Take Chum
on the Underground? Take&mdash;&mdash; Have you ever
taken a large live conger-eel on the end of a string into
a crowded carriage?"</p>

<p>The guard never had.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, don't. Take him in a taxi instead. Don't
waste him on other people."</p>

<p>The crate yawned slowly, and Chum emerged all
over straw. We had an anxious moment, but the two
of us got him down and put the lead on him. Then
Chum and I went off for a taxi.</p>

<p>"Hooray," said Chum, wriggling all over, "isn't
this splendid? I say, which way are you going?
I'm going this way?... No, I mean the other
way."</p>

<p>Somebody had left some of his milk-cans on the
platform. Three times we went round one in opposite
directions and unwound ourselves the wrong way.
Then I hauled him in, took him struggling in my arms
and got into a cab.</p>

<p>The journey to Paddington was full of interest. For
a whole minute Chum stood quietly on the seat, rested
his fore-paws on the open window and drank in London.
Then he jumped down and went mad. He tried to
hang me with the lead, and then in remorse tried to
hang himself. He made a dash for the little window
at the back; missed it and dived out of the window
at the side; was hauled back and kissed me ecstatically
in the eye with his sharpest tooth.... "And
I thought the world was at an end," he said, "and
there were no more people. Oh, I am an ass. I say,
did you notice I'd had my hair cut? How do you like
my new trousers? I must show you them." He
jumped on to my lap. "No, I think you'll see them
better on the ground," he said, and jumped down
again. "Or no, perhaps you <i>would</i> get a better view
if&mdash;&mdash;" he jumped up hastily, "and yet I don't
know&mdash;&mdash;" he dived down, "though, of course, if
you&mdash;&mdash; Oh lor! this <i>is</i> a day," and he put both paws
lovingly on my collar.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was quiet again. The stillness, the
absence of storm in the taxi was so unnatural that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
began to miss it. "Buck up, old fool," I said, but he
sat motionless by my side, plunged in thought. I tried
to cheer him up. I pointed out King's Cross to him;
he wouldn't even bark at it. I called his attention to
the poster outside the Euston Theatre of The Two
Biffs; for all the regard he showed he might never
even have heard of them. The monumental masonry
by Portland Road failed to uplift him.</p>

<p>At Baker Street he woke up and grinned cheerily.
"It's all right," he said, "I was trying to remember
what happened to me this morning&mdash;something rather
miserable, I thought, but I can't get hold of it. However,
it's all right now. How are <i>you</i>?" And he went
mad again.</p>

<p>At Paddington I bought a label at the bookstall and
wrote it for him. He went round and round my leg
looking for me. "Funny thing," he said as he began
to unwind, "he was here a moment ago. I'll just go
round once more. I rather think ... <i>Ow!</i> Oh, there
you are!" I stepped off him, unravelled the lead and
dragged him to the Parcels Office.</p>

<p>"I want to send this by the two o'clock train," I
said to the man the other side of the counter.</p>

<p>"Send what?" he said.</p>

<p>I looked down. Chum was making himself very
small and black in the shadow of the counter. He was
completely hidden from the sight of anybody the other
side of it.</p>

<p>"Come out," I said, "and show yourself."</p>

<p>"Not much," he said. "A parcel! I'm not going
to be a jolly old parcel for anybody."</p>

<p>"It's only a way of speaking," I pleaded. "Actually
you are travelling as a small black gentleman. You
will go with the guard&mdash;a delightful man."</p>

<p>Chum came out reluctantly. The clerk leant over
the counter and managed to see him.</p>

<p>"According to our regulations," he said, and I always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
dislike people who begin like that, "he has to be on a
chain. A leather lead won't do."</p>

<p>Chum smiled all over himself. I don't know which
pleased him more&mdash;the suggestion that he was a very
large and fierce dog, or the impossibility now of his
travelling with the guard, delightful man though he
might be. He gave himself a shake and started for the
door.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, it's a great disappointment to me," he
said, trying to look disappointed, but his back <i>would</i>
wriggle. "This chain business&mdash;silly of us not to have
known&mdash;well, well, we shall be wiser another time.
Now let's go home."</p>

<p>Poor old Chum; I <i>had</i> known. From a large coat
pocket I produced a chain.</p>

<p>"<i>Dash</i> it," said Chum, looking up at me pathetically,
"you might almost <i>want</i> to get rid of me."</p>

<p>He was chained, and the label tied on to him. Forgive
me that label, Chum; I think that was the worst
offence of all. And why should I label one who was
speaking so eloquently for himself; who said from the
tip of his little black nose to the end of his stumpy
black tail, "I'm a silly old ass, but there's nothing
wrong in me, and they're sending me away!" But
according to the regulations&mdash;one must obey the
regulations, Chum.</p>

<p>I gave him to the guard&mdash;a delightful man. The
guard and I chained him to a brake or something.
Then the guard went away, and Chum and I had a
little talk....</p>

<p>After that the train went off.</p>

<p>Good-bye, little dog.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_TRUTH_ABOUT_HOME_RAILS" id="THE_TRUTH_ABOUT_HOME_RAILS"></a>THE TRUTH ABOUT HOME RAILS</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Imagine</span> us, if you can, sitting one on each side of
the fire, I with my feet on the mantelpiece, Margery
curled up in the blue arm-chair, both of us intent
on the morning paper. To me, by good chance, has
fallen the sporting page; to Margery the foreign,
political, and financial intelligence of the day.</p>

<p>"What," said Margery, "does it mean when it
says&mdash;&mdash;" She stopped and spelt it over to herself
again.</p>

<p>I put down my piece of the paper and prepared to
explain. The desire for knowledge in the young cannot
be too strongly encouraged, and I have always flattered
myself that I can explain in perfectly simple language
anything which a child wants to know. For instance,
I once told Margery what "Miniature Rifle Shooting"
meant; it was a head-line which she had come across
in her paper. The explanation took some time, owing
to Margery's preconceived idea that a bird entered
into it somewhere; several times, when I thought the
lesson was over, she said, "Well, what about the
bird?" But I think I made it plain to her in the end,
though maybe she has forgotten about it now.</p>

<p>"What," said Margery, "does it mean when it says
'Home Rails Firm'?"</p>

<p>I took up my paper again. The Cambridge fifteen,
I was glad to see, were rapidly developing into a first-class
team, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Home Rails Firm,'" repeated Margery, and
looked up at me.</p>

<p>My mind worked rapidly, as it always does in a crisis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did you say?" I asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"What does 'Home Rails Firm' mean?"</p>

<p>"Where does it say that?" I went on, still thinking
at lightning speed.</p>

<p>"There. It said it yesterday too."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes." I made up my mind. "Well, <i>that</i>," I said&mdash;"I
think <i>that</i> is something you must ask your father."</p>

<p>"I did ask him yesterday."</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He told me to ask Mummy."</p>

<p>Coward!</p>

<p>"You can be sure," I said firmly, "that what
Mummy told you would be right," and I returned to
my paper.</p>

<p>"Mummy told me to wait till <i>you</i> came."</p>

<p>Really, these parents! The way they shirk their
responsibilities nowadays is disgusting.</p>

<p>"'Home Rails Firm,'" said Margery, and settled
herself to listen.</p>

<p>It is good that children should be encouraged to take
an interest in the affairs of the day, but I do think that
a little girl might be taught by her father (or if more
convenient, mother) <i>which</i> part of a newspaper to read.
Had Margery asked me the difference between a bunker
and a banker, had she demanded an explanation of
"ultimatum" or "guillotine," I could have done something
with it; but to let a child of six fill her head with
ideas as to the firmness or otherwise of Home Rails is
hardly nice. However, an explanation had to be given.</p>

<p>"Well, it's like this, Margery," I said at last. "Supposing&mdash;well,
you see, supposing&mdash;that is to say, if
<i>I</i>&mdash;&mdash;" and then I stopped. I had a sort of feeling&mdash;intuition,
they call it&mdash;that I was beginning in the
wrong way.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Margery.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had better put it this way. Supposing
you were to&mdash;&mdash; Well, we'd better begin further back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
than that. You know what&mdash;&mdash; No, I don't suppose
you do know that. Well, if I&mdash;that is to say, when a
man&mdash;you know, it's rather difficult to explain this,
Margery."</p>

<p>"Are you explaining it now?"</p>

<p>"I'm just going to begin."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Uncle."</p>

<p>I lit my pipe slowly, while I considered again how
best to approach the matter.</p>

<p>"'Home Rails Firm,'" said Margery. "Isn't it a
<i>funny</i> thing to say?"</p>

<p>It was. It was a very <i>silly</i> thing to say. Whoever
said it first might have known what it would lead to.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can explain it best like this, Margery,"
I said, beginning on a new tack. "I suppose you
know what 'firm' means?"</p>

<p>"What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"Ah, well, if you don't know <i>that</i>," I said, rather
pleased, "perhaps I had better explain that first.
'Firm' means that&mdash;that is to say, you call a thing
firm if it&mdash;well, if it doesn't&mdash;that is to say, a thing is
firm if it can't <i>move</i>."</p>

<p>"Like a house?"</p>

<p>"Well, something like that. This chair, for instance,"
and I put my hand on her chair, "is firm
because you can't shake it. You see, it's quite&mdash;&mdash; Hallo,
what's that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you bad Uncle, you've knocked the castor off
again," cried Margery, greatly excited at the incident.</p>

<p>"This is too much," I said bitterly. "Even the
furniture is against me."</p>

<p>"Go on explaining," said Margery, rocking herself
in the now wobbly chair.</p>

<p>I decided to leave "firm." It is not an easy word
to explain at the best of times, and when everything
you touch goes and breaks itself it becomes perfectly
impossible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, so much for that," I said. "And now we
come to 'rails.' You know what rails are?"</p>

<p>"Like I've got in the nursery?"</p>

<p>This was splendid. I had forgotten these for the
moment.</p>

<p>"Exactly. The rails your train goes on. Well then,
'<i>Home</i> Rails' would be rails at <i>home</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, I've <i>got</i> them at home," said Margery in
surprise. "I couldn't have them anywhere else."</p>

<p>"Quite so. Then 'Home Rails Firm' would mean
that&mdash;er&mdash;home rails were&mdash;er&mdash;firm."</p>

<p>"But mine aren't, because they wobble. You know
they do."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, why do they say 'Home Rails Firm' when
they mean 'Home Rails Wobble'?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's just it. The point is that when they
say 'Home Rails Firm,' they don't mean that the rails
<i>themselves</i> are firm. In fact, they don't mean at all
what you think they mean. They mean something
quite different."</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> they mean?"</p>

<p>"I am just going to explain," I said stiffly.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>"Or perhaps I had better put it this way," I said
ten minutes later. "Supposing&mdash;&mdash; Oh, Margery, it
<i>is</i> difficult to explain."</p>

<p>"I <i>must</i> know," said Margery.</p>

<p>"<i>Why</i> do you want to know so badly?"</p>

<p>"I want to know a million million times more than
anything else in the whole world."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"So as I can tell Angela," said Margery.</p>

<p>I plunged into my explanation again. Angela is
three, and I can quite see how important it is that she
should be sound on the question.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_KINGS_SONS" id="THE_KINGS_SONS"></a>THE KING'S SONS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="cap"><i>"<span class="dcap">Tell</span> me a story," said Margery.</i></p>

<p><i>"What sort of a story?"</i></p>

<p><i>"A fairy story, because it's Christmas-time."</i></p>

<p><i>"But you know all the fairy stories."</i></p>

<p><i>"Then tell me a new fairy story."</i></p>

<p><i>"Right," I said.</i></p></div>

<p>Once upon a time there was a King who had three
sons. The eldest son was a very thoughtful youth.
He always had a reason for everything he did, and
sometimes he would say things like "Economically
it is to the advantage of the State that&mdash;&mdash;" or "The
civic interests of the community demand that&mdash;&mdash;"
before doing something specially horrid. He didn't
want to be unkind to anybody, but he took what he
called a "large view" of things; and if you happened
to ask for a third help of plum-pudding he took the
large view that you would be sorry about it next morning&mdash;and
so you didn't have your plum-pudding. He
was called Prince Proper.</p>

<p>The second son was a very wise youth. You couldn't
catch him anyhow. If you asked him whether he
knew the story of the three wells, or "Why does a
chicken cross the road?" or anything really amusing
like that, he would always say, "Oh, I heard that
<i>years</i> ago!"&mdash;and whenever you began "Adam and
Eve and Pinchme" he would pinch you at once without
waiting like a gentleman until you had got to the
end of the verse. He was called Prince Clever.</p>

<p>And the third son was just wonderfully beautiful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
He had the most marvellously pink cheeks and long
golden hair that you have ever seen. I don't much
care for that style myself, but in the country in which
he lived it was admired more than I can tell you. He
was called Prince Goldenlocks. I'll give you three
guesses why.</p>

<p>Now the King had reigned a long time, so long that
he was tired of being king, and he often used to wonder
which of his sons ought to succeed him. Of course,
nowadays they never wonder, and the eldest son
becomes king at once, and quite right too; but in
those days it was generally left to the sons to prove
which among themselves was the most worthy. Sometimes
they would all be sent out to find the magic
Dragon's Tooth, and only one would come back alive,
which would save a lot of trouble; or else, after a lot
of discussion, they would be told to go and find beautiful
Princesses for themselves, and the one which brought
back the most beautiful Princess&mdash;but very often that
would lead to another discussion. The best way of all
was to call in a Fairy to help. A Fairy has all sorts of
tricks for finding out about you, and her favourite
plan is to pretend to be something else and see what
you do.</p>

<p>So the King called in a Fairy and said, "To-morrow
I am sending out my three sons into the world to seek
their fortune. I want you to test them for me and find
out which is the most fitted to succeed to my throne.
If it <i>should</i> happen to be Prince Goldenlocks&mdash;but, of
course, I don't want to influence you in any way."</p>

<p>"Leave it to me," said the Fairy. "You agree, no
doubt, that the quality most desirable in a king is love
and kindliness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Y-yes," said the King doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I was sure of it. Well, I have a way of putting
this quality to the test which has never yet failed."
And with that she vanished. She could have gone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
out at the door quite easily, but she preferred to
vanish.</p>

<p>I expect you know what her way was. You have
read about it often in your fairy books. On the next
day, as Prince Proper was coming along the road, she
appeared suddenly in front of him in the shape of a poor
old woman.</p>

<p>"Please give me something to buy a crust of bread,
pretty gentleman," she pleaded. "I'm starving."</p>

<p>Prince Proper looked at her sternly.</p>

<p>"Economically," he said, "it is to the advantage
of the State that the submerged classes should be a
charge on the State itself and not on individuals. The
civic interests of the community demand that promiscuous
charity should be sternly discouraged.
Surely you see that for yourself?"</p>

<p>The Fairy didn't quite. The language had taken
her by surprise. In all her previous adventures of this
kind, two of the young Princes had refused her roughly,
and the third had shared his last piece of bread with
her. This adventure was going all wrong.</p>

<p>"Let me explain it to you more fully," went on
Proper, and for an hour and twenty-seven minutes he
did so. Then he went on his way, leaving a dazed
Fairy behind him.</p>

<p>By and by Prince Clever came along. Suddenly he
saw a poor old woman in front of him.</p>

<p>"Please give me something to buy a crust of bread,"
she pleaded. "I'm starving."</p>

<p>Prince Clever burst into a roar of laughter.</p>

<p>"You don't catch <i>me</i>," he said. "I've read about
this a <i>hundred</i> times. You're not an old woman at all;
you're a Fairy."</p>

<p>"W-what do you mean?" she stammered.</p>

<p>"This is a silly test of Father's. Well, you can tell
him he's got <i>one</i> son who's clever enough to see through
him." And he went on his way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>By and by Prince Goldenlocks came along. I need
not say that he did all that you would expect of a third
and youngest son who had pink cheeks, long golden
hair, and (as I ought to have said before) a very loving
nature. He shared his last piece of bread with the poor
old woman....</p>

<p>(Surely he will get the throne!)</p>

<p>But the Fairy was an honest Fairy. She did understand
Proper's point of view; she had to admit that,
if Clever saw through her deception, it was honourable
of him to have said so. And though, of course, her
loving heart was all for Prince Goldenlocks, she felt
that it would not be fair to award the throne to him
without a further trial. So she did another thing that
she was very fond of doing. She changed herself into
a pretty little dove and&mdash;right in front of Prince Proper&mdash;she
flew with a hawk in pursuit of her. "<i>Now</i> we
shall see," she said to herself, "which of the three
youths has the softest heart."</p>

<p>You can guess what Proper said.</p>

<p>"Life," he said, "is one constant battle. Nature,"
he said, "is ruthless, and the weakest must go to the
wall. If I kill the hawk," he said, "I am kind to the
dove, but am I," he said, and I think there was a good
deal in this&mdash;"am I kind to the caterpillar or whatever
it is that the dove eats?" Of course, you know, there
<i>is</i> that to be thought of. Anyhow, after soliloquizing
for forty-seven minutes Prince Proper went on his way;
and by and by Prince Clever came along.</p>

<p>You can guess what Clever said.</p>

<p>"My whiskers!" he said, "this is older than the
last. I knew this in my cradle." With one of those
nasty sarcastic laughs that I hate so much he went on
his way; and by and by Prince Goldenlocks came
along.</p>

<p>(Now then, Goldenlocks, the throne is almost yours!)</p>

<p>You can guess what Goldenlocks said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor little dove," he said. "But I can save its
life."</p>

<p>Rapidly he fitted an arrow to his bow and with
careful aim let fly at the pursuing hawk....</p>

<p>I say again that Prince Goldenlocks was the most
beautiful youth you have ever seen in your life, and he
had a very loving nature. But he was a poor shot.</p>

<p>He hit the dove....</p>

<h3><a name="DISAPPOINTMENT" id="DISAPPOINTMENT"></a>DISAPPOINTMENT</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">My</span> young friend Bobby (now in the early
thirteens) has been making his plans for the
Christmas holidays. He communicated them
to me in a letter from school:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am going to write an opera in the holidays with
a boy called Short, a very great and confident friend of
mine here. I am doing the words and Short is doing
the music. We have already got the title; it is called
'Disappointment.'"</p>

<p>Last week, on his return to town, he came to see me
at my club, and when the waiter had brought in drinks,
and Bobby had refused a cigar, I lighted up and prepared
to talk shop. His recent discovery that I write too leads
him to treat me with more respect than formerly.</p>

<p>"Now then," I said, "tell me about it. How's it
going on?"</p>

<p>"Oo, I haven't done much yet," said Bobby. "But
I've got the plot."</p>

<p>"Let's have it."</p>

<p>Bobby unfolded it rapidly.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, there's a chap called Tommy&mdash;he's
the hero&mdash;and he's just come back from Oxford, and
he's awfully good-looking and decent and all that, and
he's in love with Felicia, you see, and there's another
chap called Reynolds, and, you see, Felicia's really the
same as Phyllis, who's going to marry Samuel, and that's
the disappointment, because Tommy wants to marry
her, you see."</p>

<p>"I see. That ought to be all right. You could
almost get two operas out of that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oo, do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Well, it depends how much Reynolds comes in.
You didn't tell me what happened to him. Does he
marry anybody?"</p>

<p>"Oo, no. He comes in because I want somebody to
tell the audience about Tommy when Tommy isn't
there."</p>

<p>(How well Bobby has caught the dramatic idea.)</p>

<p>"I see. He ought to be very useful."</p>

<p>"You see, the First Act's in a very grand restaurant,
and Tommy comes in to have dinner, and he explains
to Reynolds how he met Felicia on a boat, and she'd
lost her umbrella, and he said, 'Is this your umbrella?'
and it was, and they began to talk to each other, and
then he was in love with her. And then he goes out,
and then Reynolds tells the audience what an awfully
decent chap Tommy is."</p>

<p>"Why does he go out?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Reynolds couldn't tell everybody
what an awfully decent chap Tommy is if Tommy was
there."</p>

<p>(Of course he couldn't.)</p>

<p>"And where's Felicia all this time?"</p>

<p>"Oo, she doesn't come on: She's in the country
with Samuel. You see, the Second Act is a grand
country wedding, and Samuel and Phyllis are married,
and Tommy is one of the guests, and he's very unhappy,
but he tries not to show it, and he shoots himself."</p>

<p>"Reynolds is there too, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oo, I don't know yet."</p>

<p>(He'll have to be, of course. He'll be wanted to tell
the audience how unhappy Tommy is.)</p>

<p>"And how does it end?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, when the wedding's over, Tommy
sings a song about Felicia, and it ends up, 'Felicia,
Felicia, Felicia,' getting higher each time&mdash;Short has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to do that part, of course, but I've told him about it&mdash;and
then the curtain comes down."</p>

<p>"I see. And has Short written any of the music
yet?"</p>

<p>"He's got some of the notes. You see, I've only
just got the plot, and I've written about two pages.
I'm writing it in an exercise-book."</p>

<p>A shadow passed suddenly across the author's brow.</p>

<p>"And the sickening thing," he said, as he leant back
in his chair and sipped his ginger-beer, "is that on the
cover of it I've spelt Disappointment with two 's's.'"</p>

<p>(The troubles of this literary life!)</p>

<p>"Sickening," I agreed.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>If there is one form of theft utterly unforgivable it
is the theft by a writer of another writer's undeveloped
ideas. Borrow the plot of Sir J. M. Barrie's last play,
and you do him no harm; you only write yourself
down a plagiarist. But listen to the scenario of his
next play (if he is kind enough to read it to you) and
write it up before he has time to develop it himself, and
you do him a grievous wrong; for you fix the charge
of plagiarism on <i>him</i>. Surely, you say, no author could
sink so low as this.</p>

<p>And yet, when I got home, the plot of "Disappointment"
(with one "s") so took hold of me that I did
the unforgivable thing; I went to my desk and wrote
the opera. I make no excuses for myself. I only point
out that Bobby's opera, as performed at Covent Garden
in Italian, with Short's music conducted by Richter,
is not likely to be belittled by anything that I may
write here. I have only written in order that I may
get the scenario&mdash;which had begun to haunt me&mdash;off
my chest. Bobby, I know, will understand and forgive;
Short I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting,
but I believe he is smaller than Bobby.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>That is how I see it. But no doubt Bobby and Short,
when they really get to work, will make something
better of it. It is an engaging theme, but, of course,
the title wants to be spelt properly.</p>

<h3><a name="AMONG_THE_ANIMALS" id="AMONG_THE_ANIMALS"></a>AMONG THE ANIMALS</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Jeremy</span> was looking at a card which his wife had
just passed across the table to him.</p>

<p>"'Lady Bendish. At Home,'" he read. "'Pets.'
Is this for us?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mrs. Jeremy.</p>

<p>"Then I think 'Pets' is rather familiar. 'Mr. and
Mrs. J. P. Smith' would have been more correct."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, Jeremy. It means it's a Pet party.
You have to bring some sort of pet with you, and there
are prizes for the prettiest, and the most intelligent,
and the most companionable, and so on." She looked
at the fox-terrier curled up in front of the fire-place.
"We could take Rags, of course."</p>

<p>"Or Baby," said Jeremy. "We'll enter her in the
Fat Class."</p>

<p>But when the day arrived Jeremy had another idea.
He came in from the garden with an important look on
his face, and joined his wife in the hall.</p>

<p>"Come on," he said. "Let's start."</p>

<p>"But where's Rags?"</p>

<p>"Rags isn't coming. I'm taking Hereward instead."
He opened his cigarette-case and disclosed a small
green animal. "Hereward," he said.</p>

<p>"Why, Jeremy," cried his wife, "it's&mdash;why, it's
blight from the rose-tree!"</p>

<p>"It isn't just blight, dear; it's one particular blight.
A blight. Hereward, the Last of the Blights." He
wandered round the hall. "Where's the lead?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Jeremy, don't be absurd."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear, I must have something to lead him up
for his prize on. During the parade he can sit on my
shoulder informally, but when we come to the prize-giving,
'Mr. J. P. Smith's blight, Hereward,' must be
led on properly." He pulled open a drawer. "Oh,
here we are. I'd better take the chain; he might bite
through the leather one."</p>

<p>They arrived a little late, to find a lawn full of people
and animals; and one glance was sufficient to tell
Jeremy that in some of the classes at least his pet
would have many dangerous rivals.</p>

<p>"If there's a prize for the biggest," he said to his
wife, "my blight has practically lost it already.
Adams has brought a cart-horse. Hullo, Adams," he
went on, "how are you? Don't come too close or
Hereward may do your animal a mischief."</p>

<p>"Who's Hereward?"</p>

<p>Jeremy opened his cigarette-case.</p>

<p>"Hereward," he said. "Not the woodbine; that's
quite wild. The blight. He's much more domesticated,
but there are moments when he gets out of hand and
becomes unmanageable. He gave me the slip coming
here, and I had to chase him through the churchyard;
that's why we're late."</p>

<p>"Does he take meals with the family?" asked
Adams with a grin.</p>

<p>"No, no; he has them alone in the garden. You
ought to see him having his bath. George, our gardener,
looks after him. George gives him a special bath of
soapy water every day. Hereward simply loves it.
George squirts on him, and Hereward lies on his back
and kicks his legs in the air. It's really quite pretty
to watch them."</p>

<p>He nodded to Adams, and wandered through the
crowd with Mrs. Jeremy. The collection of animals
was remarkable; they varied in size from Adams's
cart-horse to Jeremy's blight; in playfulness from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the Vicar's kitten to Miss Trehearne's chrysalis; and
in ability for performing tricks from the Major's poodle
to Dr. Bunton's egg of the Cabbage White.</p>

<p>"There ought to be a race for them all," said Mrs.
Jeremy. "A handicap, of course."</p>

<p>"Hereward is very fast over a short distance," said
Jeremy, "but he wants encouragement. If he were
given ninety-nine yards, two feet, and eleven inches in
a hundred, and you were to stand in front of him with
a William Allan Richardson, I think we might pull it
off. But, of course, he's a bad starter. Hullo, there's
Miss Bendish."</p>

<p>Miss Bendish, hurrying along, gave them a word as
she went past.</p>

<p>"They're going to have the inspection directly," she
said, "and give the prizes. Is your animal quite
ready?"</p>

<p>"I should like to brush him up a bit," said Jeremy.
"Is there a tent or anywhere where I could prepare
him? His eyebrows get so matted if he's left to himself
for long." He took out a cigarette and lit it.</p>

<p>"There's a tent, but you'll have to hurry up."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it doesn't really matter," said Jeremy,
as he walked along with her. "Hereward's natural
beauty and agility will take him through."</p>

<p>On the south lawn the pets and their owners were
assembling. Jeremy took the leash out of his pocket
and opened his cigarette-case.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he cried. "Hereward has
escaped! Quick! Shut the gates!" He saw Adams
near and hurried up to him. "My blight has escaped,"
he said breathlessly, holding up the now useless leash.
"He gnawed through the chain and got away. I'm
afraid he may be running amok among the guests.
Supposing he were to leap upon Sir Thomas from
behind and savage him&mdash;it's too terrible." He moved
anxiously on. "Have you seen my blight?" he asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Miss Trehearne. "He has escaped, and we are rather
anxious. If he were to get the Vicar down and begin
to worry him&mdash;&mdash;" He murmured something about
"once getting the taste for blood" and hurried off.
The guests were assembled, and the judges walked down
the line and inspected their different animals. They
were almost at the end of it when Jeremy sprinted up
and took his place by the last beast.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he panted to his wife, "I've got him.
Silly of me to mislay him, but he's so confoundedly
shy." He held out his finger as the judges approached,
and introduced them to the small green pet perching
on the knuckle. "A blight," he said. "Hereward, the
Chief Blight. Been in the family for years. A dear
old friend."</p>

<p>Jeremy went home a proud man. "Mr. J. P. Smith's
blight, Hereward," had taken first prize in the All-round
class.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>"Yes," he admitted to his wife at dinner, "there is
something on my mind." He looked at the handsome
cigarette-box on the table in front of him and sighed.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear? You enjoyed yourself this
afternoon, you know you did, and Hereward won you
that beautiful cigarette-box. You ought to be
proud."</p>

<p>"That's the trouble. Hereward didn't win it."</p>

<p>"But they said&mdash;they read it out, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but they didn't know. It was really Elspeth
who won it."</p>

<p>"Elspeth?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear." Jeremy sighed again. "When
Hereward escaped and I went back for him, I didn't
find him as I&mdash;er&mdash;pretended. So I went to the rose
garden and&mdash;and borrowed Elspeth. Fortunately no
one noticed it was a lady blight ... they all took it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
for Hereward.... But it was really Elspeth&mdash;and
belonged to Lady Bendish."</p>

<p>He helped himself to a cigarette from the box.</p>

<p>"It's an interesting point," he said. "I shall go and
confess to-morrow to Sir Thomas, and see what he
thinks about it. If he wants the box back, well and
good."</p>

<p>He refilled his glass.</p>

<p>"After all," he said, "the real blow is losing Hereward.
Elspeth&mdash;Elspeth is very dear to me, but she
can never be quite the same."</p>

<h3><a name="A_TRAGEDY_OF_THE_SEA" id="A_TRAGEDY_OF_THE_SEA"></a>A TRAGEDY OF THE SEA</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">William Bales</span>&mdash;as nice a young man as
ever wore a cummerbund on an esplanade&mdash;was
in despair. For half an hour he and
Miss Spratt had been sitting in silence on the pier, and
it was still William's turn to say something. Miss
Spratt's last remark had been, "Oh, Mr. Bales, you do
say things!" and William felt that his next observation
must at all costs live up to the standard set for it.
Three or four times he had opened his mouth to speak,
and then on second thoughts had rejected the intended
utterance as unworthy. At the end of half an hour his
mind was still working fruitlessly. He knew that the
longer he waited the more brilliant he would have to
be, and he told himself that even Bernard Shaw or one
of those clever writing fellows would have been hard
put to it now.</p>

<p>William was at odds with the world. He was a
romantic young man who had once been told that he
nearly looked like Lewis Waller when he frowned, and
he had resolved that his holiday this year should be a
very dashing affair indeed. He had chosen the sea in
the hopes that some old gentleman would fall off the
pier and let himself be saved by&mdash;and, later on, photographed
with&mdash;William Bales, who in a subsequent
interview would modestly refuse to take any credit for
the gallant rescue. As his holiday had progressed he
had felt the need for some such old gentleman more
and more; for only thus, he realised, could he capture
the heart of the wayward Miss Spratt. But so far it
had been a dull season; in a whole fortnight nobody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
had gone out of his way to oblige William, and to-morrow
he must return to the City as unknown and
as unloved as when he left it.</p>

<p>"Got to go back to-morrow," he said at last. As
an impromptu it would have served, but as the result
of half an hour's earnest thought he felt that it did not
do him justice.</p>

<p>"So you said before," remarked Miss Spratt.</p>

<p>"Well, it's still true."</p>

<p>"Talking about it won't help it," said Miss Spratt.</p>

<p>William sighed and looked round the pier. There
was an old gentleman fishing at the end of it, his back
turned invitingly to William. In half an hour he had
caught one small fish (which he had had to return as
under the age limit) and a bunch of seaweed. William
felt that there was a wasted life; a life, however, which
a sudden kick and a heroic rescue by W. Bales might
yet do something to justify. At the Paddington Baths,
a month ago, he had won a plate-diving competition;
and though there is a difference between diving for
plates and diving for old gentlemen he was prepared
to waive it. One kick and then ... Fame! And,
not only Fame, but the admiration of Angelina
Spratt.</p>

<p>It was perhaps as well for the old gentleman&mdash;who
was really quite worthy, and an hour later caught a
full-sized whiting&mdash;that Miss Spratt spoke at this
moment.</p>

<p>"Well, you're good company, I must say," she
observed to William.</p>

<p>"It's so hot," said William.</p>

<p>"You can't say <i>I</i> asked to come here."</p>

<p>"Let's go on the beach," said William desperately.
"We can find a shady cave or something." Fate was
against him; there was to be no rescue that day.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'm agreeable," said Miss Spratt.</p>

<p>They walked in silence along the beach, and, rounding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
a corner of the cliffs, they came presently to a cave.
In earlier days W. Bales could have done desperate
deeds against smugglers there, with Miss Spratt looking
on. Alas for this unromantic age! It was now a place
for picnics, and a crumpled sheet of newspaper on the
sand showed that there had been one there that very
afternoon.</p>

<p>They sat in a corner of the cave, out of the sun, out
of sight of the sea, and William prepared to renew his
efforts as a conversationalist. In the hope of collecting
a few ideas as to what the London clubs were talking
about he picked up the discarded newspaper, and saw
with disgust that it was the local <i>Herald</i>. But just as
he threw it down, a line in it caught his eye and
remained in his mind:</p>

<p class="center">"<i>High tide to-day&mdash;3.30.</i>"</p>

<p>William's heart leapt. He looked at his watch; it
was 2.30. In one hour the waves would be dashing
remorselessly into the cave, would be leaping up the
cliff, what time he and Miss Spratt&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suppose they were caught by the tide....</p>

<p>Meanwhile the lady, despairing of entertainment,
had removed her hat.</p>

<p>"Really," she said, "I'm that sleepy&mdash;&mdash; I suppose
the tide's safe, Mr. Bales?"</p>

<p>It was William's chance.</p>

<p>"Quite, quite safe," he said earnestly. "It's going
down hard."</p>

<p>"Well then, I almost think&mdash;&mdash;" She closed her
eyes. "Wake me up when you've thought of something
really funny, Mr. Bales."</p>

<p>William was left alone with Romance.</p>

<p>He went out of the cave and looked round. The sea
was still some way out, but it came up quickly on this
coast. In an hour ... in an hour....</p>

<p>He scanned the cliffs, and saw the ledge whither he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
would drag her. She would cling to him crying, calling
him her rescuer....</p>

<p>What should he do then? Should he leave her
and swim for help? Or should he scale the mighty
cliff?</p>

<p>He returned to the cave and, gazing romantically at
the sleeping Miss Spratt, conjured up the scene. It
would go like this, he thought.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spratt</i> (<i>wakened by the spray dashing over her
face</i>). Oh, Mr. Bales! We're cut off by the tide!
Save me!</p>

<p><i>W. Bales</i> (<i>lightly</i>). Tut-tut, there's no danger. It's
nothing. (<i>Aside</i>) Great Heavens! Death stares us in
the face!</p>

<p><i>Miss Spratt</i> (<i>throwing her arms around his neck</i>).
William, save me; I cannot swim!</p>

<p><i>W. Bales</i> (<i>with Waller face</i>). Trust me, Angelina. I
will fight my way round yon point and obtain help.
(<i>Aside</i>) An Englishman can only die once.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spratt.</i> Don't leave me!</p>

<p><i>W. Bales.</i> Fear not, sweetheart. See, there is a
ledge where you will be beyond the reach of the hungry
tide. I will carry you thither in my arms and will
then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At this point in his day-dream William took another
look at the sleeping Miss Spratt, felt his biceps doubtfully,
and went on&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>W. Bales.</i> I will help you to climb thither, and will
then swim for help.</p>

<p><i>Miss Spratt.</i> My hero!</p>

<p>Again and again William reviewed the scene to himself.
It was perfect. His photograph would be in the
papers; Miss Spratt would worship him; he would
be a hero in his City office. The actual danger was
slight, for at the worst she could shelter in the far end
of the cave; but he would not let her know this. He
would do the thing heroically&mdash;drag her to the ledge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
on the cliff, and then swim round the point to obtain
help.</p>

<p>The thought struck him that he could conduct the
scene better in his shirt-sleeves. He removed his coat,
and then went out of the cave to reconnoitre the ledge.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>Miss Spratt awoke with a start and looked at her
watch. It was 4.15. The cave was empty save for a
crumpled page of newspaper. She glanced at this idly
and saw that it was the local <i>Herald</i> ... eight days
old.</p>

<p>Far away on the horizon William Bales was throwing
stones bitterly at the still retreating sea.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="OLD_FRIENDS" id="OLD_FRIENDS"></a>OLD FRIENDS</h3>

<p class="cap">"<span class="dcap">It</span> was very nice of you to invite me to give you
lunch," I said, "and if only the waiter would
bring the toast I should be perfectly happy. I
can't say more."</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Miss Middleton, looking up.
"Oh, I see."</p>

<p>"And now," I said, when I had finished my business
with a sardine, "tell me all about it. I know something
serious must have brought you up to London.
What is it? Have you run away from home?"</p>

<p>Miss Middleton nodded. "Sir Henery," she added
dramatically, "waits for me in his yacht at Dover.
My parents would not hear of the marriage, and immured
me in the spare room. They tried to turn me
against my love, and told wicked stories about him,
vowing that he smoked five non-throat cigarettes in a
day. Er&mdash;would you pass the pepper, please?"</p>

<p>"Go on," I begged. "Never mind the pepper."</p>

<p>"But, of course, I really came to see you," said Miss
Middleton briskly. "I want you to do something for
me."</p>

<p>"I knew it."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>do</i> say you'd love to."</p>

<p>I drained my glass and felt very brave.</p>

<p>"I'd love to," I said doubtfully. "At least, if I
were sure that&mdash;&mdash;" I lowered my voice: "Look
here&mdash;have I got to write to anybody?"</p>

<p>"No," said Miss Middleton.</p>

<p>"Let me know the worst. Have I&mdash;er&mdash;have I got
to give advice to anybody?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>There was one other point that had to be settled.
I leant across the table anxiously.</p>

<p>"Have I got to ring anybody up on the telephone?"
I asked in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing like that at all," said Miss Middleton.</p>

<p>"Dash it," I cried, "then of <i>course</i> I'll do anything
for you. What is it? Somebody you want killed?
I could kill a mayor to-day."</p>

<p>Miss Middleton was silent for a moment while allowing
herself to be helped to fish. When the waiters had
moved away, "We are having a jumble sale," she
announced.</p>

<p>I shook my head at her.</p>

<p>"Your life," I said, "is one constant round of gaiety."</p>

<p>"And I thought as I was coming to London I'd
mention it to you. Because you're always saying you
don't know what to do with your old things."</p>

<p>"I'm not <i>always</i> saying it. I may have mentioned
it once or twice when the conversation was flagging."</p>

<p>"Well, mention it now, and then I'll mention my
jumble sale."</p>

<p>I thought it over for a moment.</p>

<p>"It will mean brown paper and string," I said hopelessly,
"and I don't know where to get them."</p>

<p>"I'll buy some after lunch for you. You shall hold
my hand while I buy it."</p>

<p>"And then I should have to post it, and I'm <i>rotten</i>
at posting things."</p>

<p>"But you needn't post it, because you can meet me
at the station with it, and I'll take it home."</p>

<p>"I don't think it's quite etiquette for a young girl
to travel alone with a big brown-paper parcel. What
would Mrs. Middleton say if she knew?"</p>

<p>"Mother?" cried Miss Middleton. "But, of course,
it's her idea. You <i>didn't</i> think it was mine?" she said
reproachfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"The shock of it unnerved me for a moment. Of
course, I see now that it is Mrs. Middleton's jumble sale
entirely." I sighed and helped myself to salt. "How
do I begin?"</p>

<p>"You drive me to my dressmaker and leave me
there and go on to your rooms. And then you collect
a few really old things that you don't want and tie
them up and meet me at the 4.40. I'm afraid," she
said frankly, "it <i>is</i> a rotten way of spending an afternoon;
but I promised mother."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," I said.</p>

<p>My parcel and I arrived promptly to time. Miss
Middleton didn't.</p>

<p>"Don't say I've caught the wrong train," she said
breathlessly, when at last she appeared. "It does go
at 4.40, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"It does," I said, "and it did."</p>

<p>"Then my watch must be slow."</p>

<p>"Send it to the jumble sale," I advised. "Look
here&mdash;we've a long time to wait for the next train;
let's undress my parcel in the waiting-room, and I'll
point out the things that really want watching. Some
are absolutely unique."</p>

<p>It was an odd collection of very dear friends, Miss
Middleton's final reminder having been that <i>nothing</i>
was too old for a jumble sale.</p>

<p>"<i>Lot One</i>," I said. "A photograph of my house
cricket eleven, framed in oak. Very interesting. The
lad on the extreme right is now a clergyman."</p>

<p>"Oh, which is you?" said Miss Middleton eagerly.</p>

<p>I was too much wrapped up in my parcel to answer.
"<i>Lot Two</i>," I went on. "A pink-and-white football
shirt; would work up into a dressy blouse for adult,
or a smart overcoat for child. <i>Lot Three.</i> A knitted
waistcoat; could be used as bath-mat. <i>Lot Four.</i>
Pair of bedroom slippers in holes. This bit is the
slipper; the rest is the hole. <i>Lot Five.</i> Now this is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
something really good. <i>Truthful Jane</i>&mdash;my first prize
at my Kindergarten."</p>

<p>"Mother <i>is</i> in luck. It's just the sort of things she
wants," said Miss Middleton.</p>

<p>"Her taste is excellent. <i>Lot Six.</i> A pair of old grey
flannel trousers. <i>Lot Seven.</i> Lot Seven forward.
Where are you?" I began to go through the things
again. "Er&mdash;I'm afraid Lot Seven has already
gone."</p>

<p>"What about Lot Eight?"</p>

<p>"There doesn't seem to be a Lot Eight either. It's
very funny; I'm sure I started with more than this.
Some of the things must have eaten each other on the
way."</p>

<p>"Oh, but this is <i>heaps</i>. Can you really spare them
all?"</p>

<p>"I should feel honoured if Mrs. Middleton would
accept them," I said with a bow. "Don't forget to
tell her that in the photograph the lad on the extreme
right&mdash;&mdash;" I picked up the photograph and examined
it more carefully. "I say, <i>I</i> look rather jolly, don't
you think? I wonder if I have another copy of this
anywhere." I gazed at it wistfully. "That was my
first year for the house, you know."</p>

<p>"Don't give it away," said Miss Middleton suddenly.
"Keep it."</p>

<p>"Shall I? I don't want to deprive&mdash;&mdash; Well, I
think I will if you don't mind." My eyes wandered to
the shirt. "I've had some fun in <i>that</i> in my time," I
said thoughtfully. "The first time I wore it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You really <i>oughtn't</i> to give away your old colours,
you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, but if Mrs. Middleton," I began doubtfully&mdash;"at
least, don't you&mdash;what?&mdash;oh, all right, perhaps I
won't." I put the shirt on one side with the photograph,
and picked up the dear old comfy bedroom
slippers. I considered them for a minute and then I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
sighed deeply. As I looked up I caught Miss Middleton's
eye.... I think she had been smiling.</p>

<p>"About the slippers," she said gravely.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>"Good-bye," I said to Miss Middleton. "It's been
jolly to see you." I grasped my parcel firmly as the
train began to move. "I'm always glad to help Mrs.
Middleton, and if ever I can do so again be sure to let
me know."</p>

<p>"I will," said Miss Middleton.</p>

<p>The train went out of the station, and my parcel
and I looked about for a cab.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<h2>GETTING MARRIED</h2>

<h3 class="h3sm">I.&mdash;THE DAY</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Probably</span> you thought that getting married
was quite a simple business. So did I. We were
both wrong; it is the very dickens. Of course,
I am not going to draw back now. As I keep telling
Celia, her Ronald is a man of powerful fibre, and when
he says he will do a thing he does it&mdash;eventually.
She shall have her wedding all right; I have sworn
it. But I do wish that there weren't so many things
to be arranged first.</p>

<p>The fact that we had to fix a day was broken to me
one afternoon when Celia was showing me to some
relatives of hers in the Addison Road. I got entangled
with an elderly cousin on the hearth-rug; and though
I know nothing about motor-bicycles I talked about
them for several hours under the impression that they
were his subject. It turned out afterwards that he
was equally ignorant of them, but thought they were
mine. Perhaps we shall get on better at a second
meeting. However, just when we were both thoroughly
sick of each other, Celia broke off her gay chat with
an aunt to say to me:</p>

<p>"By the way, Ronald, we did settle on the eleventh,
didn't we?"</p>

<p>I looked at her blankly, my mind naturally full of
motor-bicycles.</p>

<p>"The wedding," smiled Celia.</p>

<p>"Right-o," I said with enthusiasm. I was glad to
be assured that I should not go on talking about motor-bicycles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
for ever, and that on the eleventh, anyhow,
there would be a short interruption for the ceremony.
Feeling almost friendly to the cousin, I plunged into
his favourite subject again.</p>

<p>On the way home Celia returned to the matter.</p>

<p>"Or you would rather it was the twelfth?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I've never heard a word about this before," I
said. "It all comes as a surprise to me."</p>

<p>"Why, I'm <i>always</i> asking you."</p>

<p>"Well, it's very forward of you, and I don't know
what young people are coming to nowadays. Celia,
what's the <i>good</i> of my talking to your cousin for three
hours about motor-bicycling? Surely one can get
married just as well without that?"</p>

<p>"One can't get married without settling the day,"
said Celia, coming cleverly back to the point.</p>

<p>Well, I suppose one can't. But somehow I had
expected to be spared all this bother. I think my
idea was that Celia would say to me suddenly one
evening, "By the way, Ronald, don't forget we're
being married to-morrow," and I should have said
"Where?" And on being told the time and place,
I should have turned up pretty punctually; and after
my best man had told me where to stand, and the
clergyman had told me what to say, and my solicitor
had told me where to sign my name, we should have
driven from the church a happy married couple ... and
in the carriage Celia would have told me where
we were spending the honeymoon.</p>

<p>However, it was not to be so.</p>

<p>"All right, the eleventh," I said. "Any particular
month?"</p>

<p>"No," smiled Celia, "just any month. Or, if you
like, every month."</p>

<p>"The eleventh of June," I surmised. "It is
probably the one day in the year on which my Uncle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Thomas cannot come. But no matter. The eleventh
let it be."</p>

<p>"Then that's settled. And at St. Miriam's?"</p>

<p>For some reason Celia has set her heart on St.
Miriam's. Personally I have no feeling about it.
St. Andrew's-by-the-Wardrobe or St. Bartholomew's-Without
would suit me equally well.</p>

<p>"All right," I said, "St. Miriam's."</p>

<p>There, you might suppose, the matter would have
ended; but no.</p>

<p>"Then you will see about it to-morrow?" said
Celia persuasively.</p>

<p>I was appalled at the idea.</p>

<p>"Surely," I said, "this is for you, or your father, or&mdash;or
somebody to arrange."</p>

<p>"Of <i>course</i> it's for the bridegroom," protested Celia.</p>

<p>"In theory, perhaps. But anyhow not the bridegroom
personally. His best man ... or his solicitor ... or ... I
mean, you're not suggesting that I
myself&mdash;&mdash; Oh, well, if you insist. Still, I must say
I don't see what's the good of having a best man <i>and</i>
a solicitor if&mdash;&mdash; Oh, all right, Celia, I'll go to-morrow."</p>

<p>So I went. For half an hour I padded round St.
Miriam's nervously, and then summoning up all my
courage, I knocked my pipe out and entered.</p>

<p>"I want," I said jauntily to a sexton or a sacristan
or something&mdash;"I want&mdash;er&mdash;a wedding." And I
added, "For two."</p>

<p>He didn't seem as nervous as I was. He enquired
quite calmly when I wanted it.</p>

<p>"The eleventh of June," I said. "It's probably the
one day in the year on which my Uncle Thomas&mdash;&mdash; However,
that wouldn't interest you. The point is
that it's the eleventh."</p>

<p>The clerk consulted his wedding-book. Then he
made the surprising announcement that the only day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
he could offer me in June was the seventeenth. I was
amazed.</p>

<p>"I am a very old customer," I said reproachfully.
"I mean, I have often been to your church in my time.
Surely&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We've weddings fixed on all the other days."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but you could persuade somebody to
change his day, couldn't you? Or if he is very much
set on being married on the eleventh you might recommend
some other church to him. I daresay you know
of some good ones. You see, Celia&mdash;my&mdash;that is, we're
particularly keen, for some reason, on St. Miriam's."</p>

<p>The clerk didn't appreciate my suggestion. He insisted
that the seventeenth was the only day.</p>

<p>"Then will you have the seventeenth?" he asked.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I can't possibly say off-hand," I
protested. "I am not alone in this. I have a friend
with me. I will go back and tell her what you say.
She may decide to withdraw her offer altogether."</p>

<p>I went back and told Celia.</p>

<p>"Bother," she said. "What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"There are other churches. There's your own, for
example."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you know I don't like that. Why
<i>shouldn't</i> we be married on the seventeenth?"</p>

<p>"I don't know at all. It seems an excellent day;
it lets in my Uncle Thomas. Of course, it may exclude
my Uncle William, but one can't have everything."</p>

<p>"Then will you go and fix it for the seventeenth
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Can't I send my solicitor this time?" I asked.
"Of course, if you particularly want me to go myself,
I will. But really, dear, I seem to be living at St.
Miriam's nowadays."</p>

<p>And even that wasn't the end of the business. For,
just as I was leaving her, Celia broke it to me that St.
Miriam's was neither in her parish nor in mine, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
that, in order to qualify as a bridegroom, I should have
to hire a room somewhere near.</p>

<p>"But I am very comfortable where I am," I assured
her.</p>

<p>"You needn't live there, Ronald. You only want
to leave a hat there, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," I sighed.</p>

<p>She came to the hall with me; and, having said
good-bye to her, I repeated my lesson.</p>

<p>"The seventeenth, fix it up to-morrow, take a room
near St. Miriam's, and leave a hat there. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye.... And oh, Ronald!" She looked
at me critically as I stood in the doorway. "You
might leave <i>that</i> one," she said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="h3sm">II.&mdash;FURNISHING</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">By</span> the way," said Celia suddenly, "what have you
done about the fixtures?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," I replied truthfully.</p>

<p>"Well, we must do <i>something</i> about them."</p>

<p>"Yes. My solicitor&mdash;he shall do something about
them. Don't let's talk about them now. I've only
got three hours more with you, and then I must dash
back to my work."</p>

<p>I must say that any mention of fixtures has always
bored me intensely. When it was a matter of getting
a house to live in I was all energy. As soon as Celia
had found it, I put my solicitor on to it; and within a
month I had signed my name in two places, and was
the owner of a highly residential flat in the best part of
the neighbourhood. But my effort so exhausted me
that I have felt utterly unable since to cope with the
question of the curtain-rod in the bathroom or whatever
it is that Celia means by fixtures. These things
will arrange themselves somehow, I feel confident.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the decorators are hard at work. A thrill
of pride inflates me when I think of the decorators at
work. I don't know how they got there; I suppose
I must have ordered them. Celia says that <i>she</i> ordered
them and chose all the papers herself, and that all I
did was to say that the papers she had chosen were
very pretty; but this doesn't sound like me in the
least. I am convinced that I was the man of action
when it came to ordering decorators.</p>

<p>"And now," said Celia one day, "we can go and
choose the electric-light fittings."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Celia," I said in admiration, "you're a wonderful
person. I should have forgotten all about them."</p>

<p>"Why, they're about the most important thing in
the flat."</p>

<p>"Somehow I never regarded anybody as choosing
them. I thought they just grew in the wall. From
bulbs."</p>

<p>When we got into the shop Celia became businesslike
at once.</p>

<p>"We'd better start with the hall," she told the man.</p>

<p>"Everybody else will have to," I said, "so we may
as well."</p>

<p>"What sort of a light did you want there?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"A strong one," I said; "so as to be able to watch
our guests carefully when they pass the umbrella-stand."</p>

<p>Celia waved me away and explained that we wanted
a hanging lantern. It appeared that this shop made
a speciality not so much of the voltage as of the lamps
enclosing it.</p>

<p>"How do you like that?" asked the man, pointing
to a magnificent affair in brass. He wandered off to a
switch, and turned it on.</p>

<p>"Dare you ask him the price?" I asked Celia. "It
looks to me about a thousand pounds. If it is, say
that you don't like the style. Don't let him think we
can't afford it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Celia, in a careless sort of way. "I'm
not sure that I care about that. How much is it?"</p>

<p>"Two pounds."</p>

<p>I was not going to show my relief. "Without the
light, of course?" I said disparagingly.</p>

<p>"How do you think it would look in the hall?"
said Celia to me.</p>

<p>"I think our guests would be encouraged to proceed.
They'd see that we were pretty good people."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't like it. It's too ornate."</p>

<p>"Then show us something less ornate," I told the
man sternly.</p>

<p>He showed us things less ornate. At the end of an
hour Celia said she thought we'd better get on to
another room, and come back to the hall afterwards.
We decided to proceed to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"We must go all out over these," said Celia; "I
want these to be really beautiful."</p>

<p>At the end of another hour Celia said she thought
we'd better get on to my workroom. My workroom,
as the name implies, is the room to which I am to
retire when I want complete quiet. Sometimes I shall
go there after lunch ... and have it.</p>

<p>"We can come back to the drawing-room afterwards,"
she said. "It's really very important that we
should get the right ones for that. Your room won't
be so difficult, but, of course, you must have awfully
nice ones."</p>

<p>I looked at my watch.</p>

<p>"It's a quarter to one," I said. "At 2.15 on the
seventeenth of June we are due at St. Miriam's. If you
think we shall have bought anything by then, let's go
on. If, as seems to me, there is no hope at all, then
let's have lunch to-day anyhow. After lunch we may
be able to find some way out of the <i>impasse</i>."</p>

<p>After lunch I had an idea.</p>

<p>"This afternoon," I said, "we will begin to get some
furniture together."</p>

<p>"But what about the electric fittings? We must
finish off those."</p>

<p>"This is an experiment. I want to see if we can
buy a chest of drawers. It may just be our day
for it."</p>

<p>"And we settle the fittings to-morrow. Yes?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. We may not want them. It all
depends on whether we can buy a chest of drawers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
this afternoon. If we can't, then I don't see how we
can ever be married on the seventeenth of June. Somebody's
got to be, because I've engaged the church. The
question is whether it's going to be us. Let's go and buy
a chest of drawers this afternoon, and see."</p>

<p>The old gentleman in the little shop Celia knew of
was delighted to see us.</p>

<p>"Chestesses? Ah, you <i>'ave</i> come to the right place."
He led the way into the depths. "There now. There's
a chest&mdash;real old, that is." He gave it a hearty smack.
"You don't see a chest like that nowadays. They
can't <i>make</i> 'em. Three pound ten. You couldn't have
got that to-morrer. I'd have sold it for four pound
to-morrer."</p>

<p>"I knew it was our day," I said.</p>

<p>"Real old, that is. Spanish me'ogany, all oak lined.
That's right, sir, pull the drawers out and see for yourself.
Let the lady see. There's no imitation there,
lady. A real old chest, that is. Come in 'ere in a week
and you'd have to pay five pounds for it. Me'ogany's
going up, you see, that's how."</p>

<p>"Well?" I said to Celia.</p>

<p>"It's perfectly sweet. Hadn't we better see some
more?"</p>

<p>We saw two more. Both of them Spanish me'ogany,
oak lined, pull-the-drawers-out-and-see-for-yourself-lady.
Half an hour passed rapidly.</p>

<p>"Well?" I said.</p>

<p>"I really don't know which I like best. Which do
you?"</p>

<p>"The first; it's nearer the door."</p>

<p>"There's another shop just over the way. We'd
better just look there too, and then we can come back
to decide to-morrow."</p>

<p>We went out. I glanced at my watch. It was 3.30,
and we were being married at 2.15 on the seventeenth
of June.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait a moment," I said, "I've forgotten my
gloves."</p>

<p>I may be a slow starter, but I am very firm when
roused. I went into the shop, wrote a cheque for the
three chests of drawers, and told the man where to send
them. When I returned, Celia was at the shop opposite,
pulling the drawers out of a real old mahogany chest
which was standing on the pavement outside.</p>

<p>"This is even better," she said. "It's perfectly
adorable. I wonder if it's more expensive."</p>

<p>"I'll just ask," I said.</p>

<p>I went in and, without an unnecessary word, bought
that chest too. Then I came back to Celia. It was
3.45, and on the seventeenth of June at 2.15&mdash;&mdash; Well,
we had four chests of drawers towards it.</p>

<p>"Celia," I said, "we may just do it yet."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="h3sm">III.&mdash;THE HONEYMOON</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I know</span> I oughtn't to be dallying here," I said; "I
ought to be doing something strenuous in preparation
for the wedding. Counting the bells at St. Miriam's,
or varnishing the floors in the flat, or&mdash;&mdash; Tell me
what I ought to be doing, Celia, and I'll go on not
doing it for a bit."</p>

<p>"There's the honeymoon," said Celia.</p>

<p>"I knew there was something."</p>

<p>"Do tell me what you're doing about it?"</p>

<p>"Thinking about it."</p>

<p>"You haven't written to any one about rooms yet?"</p>

<p>"Celia," I said reproachfully, "you seem to have
forgotten why I am marrying you."</p>

<p>When Celia was browbeaten into her present engagement,
she said frankly that she was only consenting
to marry me because of my pianola, which she had
always coveted. In return I pointed out that I was
only asking her to marry me because I wanted somebody
to write my letters. There opened before me, in
that glad moment, a vista of invitations and accounts-rendered
all answered promptly by Celia, instead of
put off till next month by me. It was a wonderful
vision to one who (very properly) detests letter-writing.
And yet, here she was, even before the ceremony,
expecting me to enter into a deliberate correspondence
with all sorts of strange people who as yet had not
come into my life at all. It was too much.</p>

<p>"We will get," I said, "your father to write some
letters for us."</p>

<p>"But what's he got to do with it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't want to complain of your father, Celia, but
it seems to me that he is not doing his fair share. There
ought to be a certain give-and-take in the matter. <i>I</i>
find you a nice church to be married in&mdash;good. <i>He</i>
finds you a nice place to honeymoon in&mdash;excellent.
After all, you are still his daughter."</p>

<p>"All right," said Celia, "I'll ask father to do it.
'Dear Mrs. Bunn, my little boy wants to spend his
holidays with you in June. I am writing to ask you
if you will take care of him and see that he doesn't
do anything dangerous. He has a nice disposition,
but wants watching.'" She patted my head gently.
"Something like that."</p>

<p>I got up and went to the writing-desk.</p>

<p>"I can see I shall have to do it myself," I sighed.
"Give me the address and I'll begin."</p>

<p>"But we haven't quite settled where we're going
yet, have we?"</p>

<p>I put the pen down thankfully and went back to
the sofa.</p>

<p>"Good! Then I needn't write to-day, anyhow. It
is wonderful, dear, how difficulties roll away when you
face them. Almost at once we arrive at the conclusion
that I needn't write to-day. Splendid! Well, where
shall we go? This will want a lot of thought. Perhaps,"
I added, "I needn't write to-morrow."</p>

<p>"We had almost fixed on England, hadn't we?"</p>

<p>"Somebody was telling me that Lynton was very
beautiful. I should like to go to Lynton."</p>

<p>"But <i>every one</i> goes to Lynton for their honeymoon."</p>

<p>"Then let's be original and go to Birmingham.
'The happy couple left for Birmingham, where the
honeymoon will be spent.' Sensation."</p>

<p>"'The bride left the train at Ealing.' More sensation."</p>

<p>"I think the great thing," I said, trying to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
businesslike, "is to fix the county first. If we fixed on
Rutland, then the rest would probably be easy."</p>

<p>"The great thing," said Celia, "is to decide what
we want. Sea, or river, or mountains, or&mdash;or golf."</p>

<p>At the word golf I coughed and looked out of the
window.</p>

<p>Now I am very fond of Celia&mdash;I mean of golf, and&mdash;what
I really mean, of course, is that I am very fond
of both of them. But I do think that on a honeymoon
Celia should come first. After all, I shall have plenty
of other holidays for golf ... although, of course,
three weeks in the summer without any golf at all&mdash;&mdash; Still,
I think Celia should come first.</p>

<p>"Our trouble," I said to her, "is that neither of us
has ever been on a honeymoon before, and so we've
no idea what it will be like. After all, why should we
get bored with each other? Surely we don't depend
on golf to amuse us?"</p>

<p>"All the same, I think your golf <i>would</i> amuse me,"
said Celia. "Besides, I want you to be as happy as
you possibly can be."</p>

<p>"Yes, but supposing I was slicing my drives all the
time, I should be miserable. I should be torn between
the desire to go back to London and have a lesson with
the professional and the desire to stay on honeymooning
with you. One can't be happy in a quandary like
that."</p>

<p>"Very well then, no golf. Settled?"</p>

<p>"Quite. Now then, let's decide about the scenery.
What sort of soil do you prefer?"</p>

<p>When I left Celia that day we had agreed on this
much: that we wouldn't bother about golf, and that
the mountains, rivers, valleys, and so on should be left
entirely to nature. All we were to enquire for was (in
the words of an advertisement Celia had seen) "a
perfect spot for a honeymoon."</p>

<p>In the course of the next day I heard of seven spots;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
varying from a spot in Surrey "dotted with firs," to a
dot in the Pacific spotted with&mdash;I forget what, natives
probably. Taken together they were the seven only
possible spots for a honeymoon.</p>

<p>"We shall have to have seven honeymoons," I said
to Celia when I had told her my news. "One honeymoon,
one spot."</p>

<p>"Wait," she said. "I have heard of an ideal
spot."</p>

<p>"Speaking as a spot expert, I don't think that's
necessarily better than an only possible spot," I
objected. "Still, tell me about it."</p>

<p>"Well, to begin with, it's close to the sea."</p>

<p>"So we can bathe when we're bored. Good."</p>

<p>"And it's got a river, if you want to fish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't. I should hate to catch a fish who was
perhaps on his honeymoon too. Still, I like the idea
of a river."</p>

<p>"And quite a good mountain, and lovely walks,
and, in fact, everything. Except a picture-palace,
luckily."</p>

<p>"It sounds all right," I said doubtfully. "We
might just spend the next day or two thinking about
my seven spots, and then I might ... possibly ...
feel strong enough to write."</p>

<p>"Oh, I nearly forgot. I <i>have</i> written, Ronald."</p>

<p>"You have?" I cried. "Then, my dear, what else
matters? It's a perfect spot." I lay back in relief.
"And there, thank 'evings, is another thing settled.
Bless you."</p>

<p>"Yes. And, by the way, there <i>is</i> golf quite close too.
But that," she smiled, "needn't prevent us going
there."</p>

<p>"Of course not. We shall just ignore the course."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, so as to be on the safe side, you'd better
leave your clubs behind."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'd better," I said carelessly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>All the same I don't think I will. One never knows
what may happen ... and at the outset of one's
matrimonial career to have to go to the expense of an
entirely new set of clubs would be a most regrettable
business.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>
<h3 class="h3sm">IV.&mdash;SEASONABLE PRESENTS</h3>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I suppose</span>," I said, "it's too late to cancel this
wedding now?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Celia, "the invitations are out, and
the presents are pouring in, and mother's just ordered
the most melting dress for herself that you ever saw.
Besides, who's to live in the flat if we don't?"</p>

<p>"There's a good deal in what you say. Still, I am
alarmed, seriously alarmed. Look here." I drew out
a printed slip and flourished it before her.</p>

<p>"Not a writ? My poor Ronald!"</p>

<p>"Worse than that. This is the St. Miriam's bill of
fare for weddings. Celia, I had no idea marriage was
so expensive. I thought one rolled-gold ring would
practically see it."</p>

<p>It was a formidable document. Starting with "full
choir and organ" which came to a million pounds, and
working down through "boys' voices only," and "red
carpet" to "policemen for controlling traffic&mdash;per
policeman, 5s.," it included altogether some two dozen
ways of disposing of my savings.</p>

<p>"If we have the whole <i>menu</i>," I said, "I shall be
ruined. You wouldn't like to have a ruined
husband."</p>

<p>Celia took the list and went through it carefully.</p>

<p>"I might say 'Season,'" I suggested, "or 'Press.'"</p>

<p>"Well, to begin with," said Celia, "we needn't have
a full choir."</p>

<p>"Need we have an organ or a choir at all? In
thanking people for their kind presents you might add,
'By the way, do you sing?' Then we could arrange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to have all the warblers in the front. My best man or
my solicitor could give the note."</p>

<p>"Boys' voices only," decided Celia. "Then what
about bells?"</p>

<p>"I should like some nice bells. If the price is 'per
bell' we might give an order for five good ones."</p>

<p>"Let's do without bells. You see, they don't begin
to ring till we've left the church, so they won't be any
good to <i>us</i>."</p>

<p>This seemed to me an extraordinary line to take.</p>

<p>"My dear child," I remonstrated, "the whole thing
is being got up not for ourselves, but for our guests.
We shall be much too preoccupied to appreciate any
of the good things we provide&mdash;the texture of the red
carpet or the quality of the singing. I dreamt last
night that I quite forgot about the wedding-ring till
1.30 on the actual day, and the only cab I could find
to take me to a jeweller's was drawn by a camel. Of
course, it may not turn out to be as bad as that, but it
will certainly be an anxious afternoon for both of us.
And so we must consider the entertainment entirely
from the point of view of our guests. Whether their
craving is for champagne or bells, it must be satisfied."</p>

<p>"I'm sure they'll be better without bells. Because
when the policemen call out 'Mr. Spifkins' carriage,'
Mr. Spifkins mightn't hear if there were a lot of bells
clashing about."</p>

<p>"Very well, no bells. But, mind you," I said sternly,
"I shall insist on a clergyman."</p>

<p>We went through the rest of the <i>menu</i>, course by course.</p>

<p>"I know what I shall do," I said at last. "I shall
call on my friend the Clerk again, and I shall speak to
him quite frankly. I shall say, 'Here is a cheque for a
thousand pounds. It is all I can afford&mdash;and, by the
way, you'd better pay it in quickly or it will be dishonoured.
Can you do us up a nice wedding for a
thousand inclusive?'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Like the Christmas hampers at the stores."</p>

<p>"Exactly. A dozen boys' voices, a half-dozen of
bells, ten yards of awning, and twenty-four oranges,
or vergers, or whatever it is. We ought to get a nice
parcel for a thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Or," said Celia, "we might send the list round to
our friends as suggestions for wedding presents. I'm
sure Jane would love to give us a couple of policemen."</p>

<p>"We'd much better leave the whole thing to your
father. I incline more and more to the opinion that
it is <i>his</i> business to provide the wedding. I must ask
my solicitor about it."</p>

<p>"He's providing the bride."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I think he might go further. I can't help
feeling that the bells would come very well from him.
'Bride's father to bridegroom&mdash;A peal of bells.'
People would think it was something in silver for the
hall. It would do him a lot of good in business circles."</p>

<p>"And that reminds me," smiled Celia, "there's been
some talk about a present from Miss Popley."</p>

<p>I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible
to get married decently unless one's life is ordered on
some sort of system. Mine never has been; and the
result is that I make terrible mistakes&mdash;particularly in
the case of Miss Popley. At the beginning of the business,
when the news got round to Miss Popley, I received
from her a sweet letter of congratulation.
Knowing that she was rather particular in these
matters I braced myself up and thanked her heartily
by return of post. Three days later, when looking for
a cheque I had lost, I accidentally came across her
letter. "Help, help!" I cried. "This came days ago,
and I haven't answered yet." I sat down at once and
thanked her enthusiastically. Another week passed
and I began to feel that I must really make an effort
to catch my correspondence up; so I got out all my
letters of congratulation of the last ten days and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
devoted an afternoon to answering them. I used much
the same form of thanks in all of them ... with the
exception of Miss Popley's, which was phrased particularly
warmly.</p>

<p>So much for that. But Miss Popley is Celia's dear
friend also. When I made out my list of guests I included
Miss Popley; so, in her list, did Celia. The
result was that Miss Popley received two invitations
to the wedding.... Sometimes I fear she must think
we are pursuing her.</p>

<p>"What does she say about a present?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She wants us to tell her what we want."</p>

<p>"What <i>are</i> we to say? If we said an elephant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With a small card tied on to his ear, and 'Best
wishes from Miss Popley' on it. It would look heavenly
among the other presents."</p>

<p>"You see what I mean, Celia. Are we to suggest
something worth a thousand pounds, or something
worth ninepence? It's awfully kind of her, but it
makes it jolly difficult for us."</p>

<p>"Something that might cost anything from ninepence
to a thousand pounds," suggested Celia.</p>

<p>"Then that washes out the elephant."</p>

<p>"Can't you get the ninepenny ones now?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," I said, reverting to the subject which
most weighed on me, "she wouldn't like to give the
men's voices for the choir?"</p>

<p>"No, I think a clock," said Celia. "A clock can
cost anything you like&mdash;or don't like."</p>

<p>"Right-o. And perhaps we'd better settle now.
When it comes, how many times shall we write and
thank her for it?"</p>

<p>Celia considered. "Four times, I think," she said.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>Well, as Celia says, it's too late to draw back now.
But I shall be glad when it's all over. As I began by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
saying, there's too much "arranging" and "settling"
and "fixing" about the thing for me. In the necessary
negotiations and preparations I fear I have not shone.
And so I shall be truly glad when we have settled down
in our flat ... and Celia can restore my confidence
in myself once more by talking loudly to her domestic
staff about "The Master."</p>

<h3><a name="AN_INSURANCE_ACT" id="AN_INSURANCE_ACT"></a>AN INSURANCE ACT</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Of</span> course, I had always known that a medical
examination was a necessary preliminary to
insurance, but in my own case I had expected
the thing to be the merest formality. The doctor,
having seen at a glance what a fine, strong, healthy
fellow I was, would look casually at my tongue,
apologise for having doubted it, enquire genially what
my grandfather had died of, and show me to the door.
This idea of mine was fostered by the excellent testimonial
which I had written myself at the Company's
bidding. "Are you suffering from any constitutional
disease?&mdash;<i>No</i>. Have you ever had gout?&mdash;<i>No</i>. Are
you deformed?&mdash;<i>No</i>. Are you of strictly sober and
temperate habits?&mdash;<i>No</i>," I mean <i>Yes</i>. My replies
had been a model of what an Assurance Company
expects. Then why the need of a doctor?</p>

<p>However, they insisted.</p>

<p>The doctor began quietly enough. He asked, as I
had anticipated, after the health of my relations. I
said that they were very fit; and, not to be outdone
in politeness, expressed the hope that <i>his</i> people, too,
were keeping well in this trying weather. He wondered
if I drank much. I said, "Oh, well, perhaps I <i>will</i>,"
with an apologetic smile, and looked round for the
sideboard. Unfortunately he did not pursue the
matter....</p>

<p>"And now," he said, after the hundredth question,
"I should like to look at your chest."</p>

<p>I had seen it coming for some time. In vain I had
tried to turn the conversation&mdash;to lead him back to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the subject of drinks or my relations. It was no good.
He was evidently determined to see my chest. Nothing
could move him from his resolve.</p>

<p>Trembling, I prepared for the encounter. What
terrible disease was he going to discover?</p>

<p>He began by tapping me briskly all over in a series
of double knocks. For the most part one double-knock
at any point appeared to satisfy him, but occasionally
there would be no answer and he would knock again.
At one spot he knocked four times before he could
make himself heard.</p>

<p>"This," I said to myself at the third knock, "has
torn it. I shall be ploughed," and I sent an urgent
message to my chest, "For 'eving's sake <i>do</i> something,
you fool! Can't you hear the gentleman?" I suppose
that roused it, for at the next knock he passed on to
an adjacent spot....</p>

<p>"Um," he said, when he had called everywhere,
"um."</p>

<p>"I wonder what I've done," I thought to myself.
"I don't believe he likes my chest."</p>

<p>Without a word he got out his stethoscope and began
to listen to me. As luck would have it he struck something
interesting almost at once, and for what seemed
hours he stood there listening and listening to it. But
it was boring for me, because I really had very little
to do. I could have bitten him in the neck with some
ease ... or I might have licked his ear. Beyond that,
nothing seemed to offer.</p>

<p>I moistened my lips and spoke.</p>

<p>"Am I dying?" I asked in a broken voice.</p>

<p>"Don't talk," he said. "Just breathe naturally."</p>

<p>"I am dying," I thought, "and he is hiding it from
me." It was a terrible reflection.</p>

<p>"Um," he said and moved on.</p>

<p>By and by he went and listened behind my back.
It is very bad form to listen behind a person's back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
I did not tell him so, however. I wanted him to
like me.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Now cough."</p>

<p>"I haven't a cough," I pointed out.</p>

<p>"Make the noise of coughing," he said severely.</p>

<p>Extremely nervous, I did my celebrated imitation
of a man with an irritating cough.</p>

<p>"H'm! h'm! h'm! h'm!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the doctor. "Go on."</p>

<p>"He likes it," I said to myself, "and he must
obviously be an excellent judge. I shall devote more
time to mimicry in future. H'm! h'm! h'm!..."</p>

<p>The doctor came round to where I could see him
again.</p>

<p>"Now cough like this," he said. "Honk! honk!"</p>

<p>I gave my celebrated imitation of a sick rhinoceros
gasping out its life. It went well. I got an encore.</p>

<p>"Um," he said gravely, "um." He put his stethoscope
away and looked earnestly at me.</p>

<p>"Tell me the worst," I begged. "I'm not bothering
about this stupid insurance business now. That's off,
of course. But&mdash;how long have I? I must put my
affairs in order. Can you promise me a week?"</p>

<p>He said nothing. He took my wrists in his hands
and pressed them. It was evident that grief over-mastered
him and that he was taking a silent farewell
of me. I bowed my head. Then, determined to bear
my death-sentence like a man, I said firmly, "So be
it," and drew myself away from him.</p>

<p>However, he wouldn't let me go.</p>

<p>"Come, come," I said to him, "you must not give
way"; and I made an effort to release one of my
hands, meaning to pat him encouragingly on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>He resisted....</p>

<p>I realized suddenly that I had mistaken his meaning,
and that he was simply feeling my pulses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Um," he said, "um," and continued to finger my
wrists.</p>

<p>Clenching my teeth, and with the veins starting out
on my forehead, I worked my pulses as hard as I could.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>"Ah," he said, as I finished tying my tie; and he
got up from the desk where he had been making notes
of my disastrous case, and came over to me. "There
is just one thing more. Sit down."</p>

<p>I sat down.</p>

<p>"Now cross your knees."</p>

<p>I crossed my knees. He bent over me and gave me
a sharp tap below the knee with the side of his hand.</p>

<p>My chest may have disappointed him.... He may
have disliked my back.... Possibly I was a complete
failure with my pulses.... But I knew the knee-trick.</p>

<p>This time he should not be disappointed.</p>

<p>I was taking no risks. Almost before his hand reached
my knee, my foot shot out and took him fairly under
the chin. His face suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>"I haven't got <i>that</i> disease," I said cheerily.</p>

<h3><a name="BACHELOR_RELICS" id="BACHELOR_RELICS"></a>BACHELOR RELICS</h3>

<p class="cap">"<span class="dcap">Do</span> you happen to want," I said to Henry,
"an opera hat that doesn't op? At least
it only works on one side."</p>

<p>"No," said Henry.</p>

<p>"To any one who buys my opera hat for a large sum
I am giving away four square yards of linoleum, a
revolving book-case, two curtain rods, a pair of spring-grip
dumb-bells, and an extremely patent mouse-trap."</p>

<p>"No," said Henry again.</p>

<p>"The mouse-trap," I pleaded, "is unused. That is
to say, no mouse has used it yet. My mouse-trap has
never been blooded."</p>

<p>"I don't want it myself," said Henry, "but I know
a man who does."</p>

<p>"Henry, you know everybody. For Heaven's sake
introduce me to your friend. Why does he particularly
want a mouse-trap?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't. He wants anything that's old. Old
clothes, old carpets, anything that's old he'll buy."</p>

<p>He seemed to be exactly the man I wanted.</p>

<p>"Introduce me to your fellow clubman," I said
firmly.</p>

<p>That evening I wrote to Henry's friend, Mr. Bennett.
"Dear Sir," I wrote, "if you would call upon me to-morrow
I should like to show you some really old things,
all genuine antiques. In particular I would call your
attention to an old opera hat of exquisite workmanship
and a mouse-trap of chaste and handsome design. I
have also a few yards of Queen Anne linoleum of a
circular pattern which I think will please you. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
James the First spring-grip dumb-bells and Louis
Quatorze curtain-rods are well known to connoisseurs.
A genuine old cork bedroom suite, comprising one bath-mat,
will also be included in the sale. Yours faithfully."</p>

<p>On second thoughts I tore the letter up and sent
Mr. Bennett a postcard asking him to favour the undersigned
with a call at 10.30 prompt. And at 10.30
prompt he came.</p>

<p>I had expected to see a bearded patriarch with a
hooked nose and three hats on his head, but Mr.
Bennett turned out to be a very spruce gentleman,
wearing (I was sorry to see) much better clothes than
the opera hat I proposed to sell him. He became
businesslike at once.</p>

<p>"Just tell me what you want to sell," he said,
whipping out a pocket-book, "and I'll make a note
of it. I take anything."</p>

<p>I looked round my spacious apartment and wondered
what to begin with.</p>

<p>"The revolving book-case," I announced.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there's very little sale for revolving
book-cases now," he said, as he made a note of it.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," I pointed out, "this one
doesn't revolve. It got stuck some years ago."</p>

<p>He didn't seem to think that this would increase the
rush, but he made a note of it.</p>

<p>"Then the writing-desk."</p>

<p>"The what?"</p>

<p>"The Georgian bureau. A copy of an old twentieth-century
escritoire."</p>

<p>"Walnut?" he said, tapping it.</p>

<p>"Possibly. The value of this Georgian writing-desk,
however, lies not in the wood but in the literary
associations."</p>

<p>"Ah! My customers don't bother much about
that, but still&mdash;whose was it?"</p>

<p>"Mine," I said with dignity, placing my hand in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the breast pocket of my coat. "I have written many
charming things at that desk. My 'Ode to a Bell-push,'
my 'Thoughts on Asia,' my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anything else in this room?" said Mr. Bennett.
"Carpet, curtains&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing else," I said coldly.</p>

<p>We went into the bedroom and, gazing on the
linoleum, my enthusiasm returned to me.</p>

<p>"The linoleum," I said, with a wave of the hand.</p>

<p>"Very much worn," said Mr. Bennett.</p>

<p>I called his attention to the piece under the bed.</p>

<p>"Not under there," I said. "I never walk on that
piece. It's as good as new."</p>

<p>He made a note. "What else?" he said.</p>

<p>I showed him round the collection. He saw the
Louis Quatorze curtain-rods, the cork bedroom suite,
the C&aelig;sarian nail-brush (quite bald), the antique
shaving-mirror with genuine crack&mdash;he saw it all. And
then we went back into the other rooms and found
some more things for him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, consulting his note-book. "And
now how would you like me to buy these?"</p>

<p>"At a large price," I said. "If you have brought
your cheque-book I'll lend you a pen."</p>

<p>"You want me to make you an offer? Otherwise
I should sell them by auction for you, deducting ten
per cent commission."</p>

<p>"Not by auction," I said impulsively. "I couldn't
bear to know how much, or rather how little, my
Georgian bureau fetched. It was there, as I think I
told you, that I wrote my <i>Guide to the Round Pond</i>.
Give me an inclusive price for the lot, and never, never
let me know the details."</p>

<p>He named an inclusive price. It was something
under a hundred and fifty pounds. I shouldn't have
minded that if it had only been a little over ten pounds.
But it wasn't.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Right," I agreed. "And, oh, I was nearly forgetting.
There's an old opera hat of exquisite workmanship,
which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, now, clothes had much better be sold by
auction. Make a pile of all you don't want and I'll
send round a sack for them. I have an auction sale
every Wednesday."</p>

<p>"Very well. Send round to-morrow. And you
might&mdash;er&mdash;also send round a&mdash;er&mdash;cheque for&mdash;quite
so. Well, then, good morning."</p>

<p>When he had gone I went into my bedroom and
made a pile of my opera hat. It didn't look very impressive&mdash;hardly
worth having a sack specially sent
round for it. To keep it company I collected an assortment
of clothes. It pained me to break up my wardrobe
in this way, but I wanted the bidding for my
opera hat to be brisk, and a few preliminary suits would
warm the public up. Altogether it was a goodly pile
when it was done. The opera hat perched on the top,
half of it only at work.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>To-day I received from Mr. Bennett a cheque, a
catalogue, and an account. The catalogue was marked
"Lots 172-179." Somehow I felt that my opera hat
would be Lot 176. I turned to it in the account.</p>

<p>"Lot 176&mdash;Six shillings."</p>

<p>"It did well," I said. "Perhaps in my heart of
hearts I hoped for seven and sixpence, but six shillings&mdash;yes,
it was a good hat."</p>

<p>And then I turned to the catalogue.</p>

<p>"<i>Lot 176</i>&mdash;Frock-coat and vest, dress-coat and vest,
ditto, pair of trousers and opera hat."</p>

<p>"<i>And opera hat.</i>" Well, well. At least it had the
position of honour at the end. My opera hat was
starred.</p>

<h3><a name="LORDS_TEMPORAL" id="LORDS_TEMPORAL"></a>LORDS TEMPORAL</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">We</span> have eight clocks, called after the kind
people who gave them to us. Let me
introduce you: William, Edward, Muriel,
Enid, Alphonse, Percy, Henrietta, and John&mdash;a large
family.</p>

<p>"But how convenient," said Celia. "Exactly one
for each room."</p>

<p>"Or two in each corner of the drawing-room. I
don't suggest it; I just throw out the idea."</p>

<p>"Which is rejected. How shall we arrange which
goes into which room? Let's pick up. I take William
for the drawing-room; you take John for your workroom;
I take&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not John," I said gently. John is&mdash;&mdash; John overdoes
it a trifle. There is too much of John; and he
exposes his inside&mdash;which is not quite nice.</p>

<p>"Well, whichever you like. Come on, let's begin.
William."</p>

<p>As it happened, I particularly wanted William. He
has an absolutely noiseless tick, such as is suitable to
a room in which work is to be done. I explained this
to Celia.</p>

<p>"What you want for the drawing-room," I went on,
"is a clock which ticks ostentatiously, so that your
visitors may be reminded of the flight of time. Edward
is a very loud breather. No guest could fail to notice
Edward."</p>

<p>"William," said Celia firmly.</p>

<p>"William has a very delicate interior," I pleaded.
"You could never attend to him properly. I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
been thinking of William ever since we had him, and
I feel that I understand his case."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Celia, with sudden generosity;
"Edward. You have William; I have Alphonse for
the dining-room; you have John for your bedroom;
I have Enid for mine; you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not John," I said gently. To be frank, John is
improper.</p>

<p>"Well, Percy, then."</p>

<p>"Yes, Percy. He is young and fair. He shall sit on
the chest of drawers and sing to my sock-suspenders."</p>

<p>"Then Henrietta had better go in the spare room,
and Muriel in Jane's."</p>

<p>"Muriel is much too good for Jane," I protested.
"Besides, a servant wants an alarm clock to get her
up in the morning."</p>

<p>"You forget that Muriel cuckoos. At six o'clock
she will cuckoo exactly six times, and at the sixth 'oo'
Jane brisks out of bed."</p>

<p>I still felt a little doubtful, because the early morning
is a bad time for counting cuckoos, and I didn't see
why Jane shouldn't brisk out at the seventh "oo" by
mistake one day. However, Jane is in Celia's department,
and if Celia was satisfied I was. Besides, the
only other place for Muriel was the bathroom; and
there is something about a cuckoo-clock in a bathroom
which&mdash;well, one wants to be educated up to it.</p>

<p>"And that," said Celia gladly, "leaves the kitchen
for John." John, as I think I have said, displays his
inside in a lamentable way. There is too much of John.</p>

<p>"If Jane doesn't mind," I added. "She may have
been strictly brought up."</p>

<p>"She'll love him. John lacks reserve, but he is a
good time-keeper."</p>

<p>And so our eight friends were settled. But, alas,
not for long. Our discussion had taken place on the
eve of Jane's arrival; and when she turned up next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
day she brought with her, to our horror, a clock of her
own&mdash;called, I think, Mother. At any rate, she was
fond of it and refused to throw it away.</p>

<p>"And it's got an alarm, so it goes in her bedroom,"
said Celia, "and Muriel goes into the kitchen. Jane
loves it, because she comes from the country, and the
cuckoo reminds her of home. That still leaves John
eating his head off."</p>

<p>"And, moreover, showing people what happens to
it," I added severely. (I think I have already mentioned
John's foible.)</p>

<p>"Well, there's only one thing for it; he must go
under the spare-room bed."</p>

<p>I tried to imagine John under the spare-room bed.</p>

<p>"Suppose," I said, "we had a nervous visitor ...
and she looked under the bed before getting into it
... and saw John.... It is a terrible thought,
Celia."</p>

<p>However, that is where he is. It is a lonely life for
him, but we shall wind him up every week, and he will
think that he is being of service to us. Indeed, he
probably imagines that our guests prefer to sleep
under the bed.</p>

<p>Now, with John at last arranged for, our family
should have been happy; but three days ago I discovered
that it was William who was going to be the
real trouble. To think of William, the pride of the
flock, betraying us!</p>

<p>As you may remember, William lives with me. He
presides over the room we call "the library" to visitors
and "the master's room" to Jane. He smiles at me
when I work. Ordinarily, when I want to know the
time, I look at my watch; but the other morning I
happened to glance at William. He said "twenty
minutes past seven." As I am never at work as early
as that, and as my watch said eleven-thirty, I guessed
at once that William had stopped. In the evening&mdash;having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
by that time found the key&mdash;I went to wind
him up. To my surprise he said "six-twenty-five."
I put my ear to his chest and heard his gentle breathing.
He was alive and going well. With a murmured
apology I set him to the right time ... and by the
morning he was three-quarters of an hour fast.</p>

<p>Unlike John, William is reticent to a degree. With
great difficulty I found my way to his insides, and then
found that he had practically none to speak of at all.
Certainly he had no regulator.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" I asked Celia.</p>

<p>"Leave him. And then, when you bring your guests
in for a smoke, you can say, 'Oh, don't go yet; this
clock is five hours and twenty-three minutes fast.'"</p>

<p>"Or six hours and thirty-seven minutes slow. I
wonder which would sound better. Anyhow, he is
much too beautiful to go under a bed."</p>

<p>So we are leaving him. And when I am in the mood
for beauty I look at William's mahogany sides and am
soothed into slumber again ... and when I want to
adjust my watch (which always loses a little), I creep
under the spare-room bed and consult John. John
alone of all our family keeps the correct time, and it is
a pity that he alone must live in retirement.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_MISSING_CARD" id="THE_MISSING_CARD"></a>THE MISSING CARD</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">What</span> I say is this: A man has his own
work to do. He slaves at the office all day,
earning a living for those dependent on
him, and when he comes home he may reasonably
expect not to be bothered with domestic business. I
am sure you will agree with me. And you would go
on to say, would you not, that, anyhow, the insuring
of his servants might safely be left to his wife? Of
course you would! Thank you very much.</p>

<p>I first spoke to Celia about the insuring of the staff
some weeks ago. Our staff consists of Jane Parsons
the cook, the first parlourmaid (Jane) and Parsons the
upper housemaid. We call them collectively Jane.</p>

<p>"By the way," I said to Celia, "I suppose Jane is
insured all right?"</p>

<p>"I was going to see about it to-morrow," said Celia.</p>

<p>I looked at her in surprise. It was just the sort of
thing I might have said myself.</p>

<p>"I hope she won't be unkind about it," I went on.
"If she objects to paying her share, tell her I am
related to a solicitor. If she still objects, er&mdash;tell her
we'll pay it ourselves."</p>

<p>"I think it will be all right. Fortunately, she has
no head for figures."</p>

<p>This is true. Jane is an excellent cook, and well
worth the &pound;75 a year or whatever it is we pay her; but
arithmetic gives her a headache. When Celia has
finished dividing &pound;75 by twelve, Jane is in a state of
complete nervous exhaustion, and is only too thankful
to take the nine-and-sixpence that Celia hands over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to her, without asking any questions. Indeed, <i>anything</i>
that the Government wished deducted from Jane's
wages we could deduct with a minimum of friction&mdash;from
income-tax to a dog-licence. A threepenny
insurance would be child's play.</p>

<p>Three weeks later I said to Celia&mdash;</p>

<p>"Has an inspector been to see Jane's card yet?"</p>

<p>"Jane's card?" she asked blankly.</p>

<p>"The insurance card with the pretty stamps on."</p>

<p>"No.... No.... Luckily."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was going to see about it to-morrow," said
Celia.</p>

<p>I got up and paced the floor. "Really," I murmured,
"really." I tried the various chairs in the
room, and finally went and stood with my back to the
fire-place. In short, I behaved like a justly incensed
master-of-the-house.</p>

<p>"You know what happens," I said, when I was calm
again, "if we neglect this duty which Parliament has
laid upon us?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"We go to prison. At least, one of us does. I'm
not quite sure which."</p>

<p>"I hope it's you," said Celia.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact I believe it is. However, we
shall know when the inspector comes round."</p>

<p>"If it's you," she went on, "I shall send you in a
file, with which you can cut through your chains and
escape. It will be concealed in a loaf of bread, so that
your gaolers shan't suspect."</p>

<p>"Probably I shouldn't suspect either, until I had
bitten on it suddenly. Perhaps you'd better not
bother. It would be simpler if you got Jane's card
to-morrow instead."</p>

<p>"But of course I will. That is to say, I'll tell Jane
to get it herself. It's her cinema evening out."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Once a week Jane leaves us and goes to a cinema.
Her life is full of variety.</p>

<p>Ten days elapsed, and then one evening I said&mdash;&mdash; At
least I didn't. Before I could get it out Celia
interrupted:</p>

<p>"No, not yet. You see, there's been a hitch."</p>

<p>I curbed my anger and spoke calmly.</p>

<p>"What sort of a hitch?"</p>

<p>"Well, Jane forgot last Wednesday, and I forgot to
remind her this Wednesday. But <i>next</i> Wednesday&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why don't you do it yourself?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you'll tell me what to do I'll do it."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;you just&mdash;you&mdash;I mean&mdash;well, they'll
tell you at the post-office."</p>

<p>"That's exactly how I keep explaining it to Jane,"
said Celia.</p>

<p>I looked at her mournfully.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" I asked. "I feel quite hopeless
about it. It seems too late now to do anything
with Jane. Let's get a new staff and begin again
properly."</p>

<p>"Lose Jane?" cried Celia. "I'd sooner go to
prison&mdash;I mean I'd sooner <i>you</i> went to prison. Why
can't you be a man and do something?"</p>

<p>Celia doesn't seem to realize that I married her with
the sole idea of getting free of all this sort of bother.
As it is, I nearly die once a year in the attempt to fill
up my income-tax form. Any traffic in insurance
cards would, my doctor says, be absolutely fatal.</p>

<p>However, something had to be done. Last week I
went into a neighbouring post-office in order to send
a telegram. The post-office is an annexe of the grocer's
where the sardines come from on Jane's cinema evening.
Having sent the telegram, I took a sudden desperate
resolve. I&mdash;I myself&mdash;would do something.</p>

<p>"I want," I said bravely, "an insurance stamp."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sixpenny or sevenpenny?" said the girl, trying
to put me off my balance at the very beginning.</p>

<p>"What's the difference?" I asked. "You needn't
say a penny, because that is obvious."</p>

<p>However, she had no wish to be funny.</p>

<p>"Sevenpenny for men-servants, sixpenny for
women," she explained.</p>

<p>I wasn't going to give away our domestic arrangements
to so near a neighbour.</p>

<p>"Three sixpenny and four sevenpenny," I said
casually, flicking the dust off my shoes with a handkerchief.
"Tut, tut, I was forgetting Thomas," I added.
"Five sevenpenny."</p>

<p>I took the stamps home and showered them on
Celia.</p>

<p>"You see," I said, "it's not really difficult."</p>

<p>"Oh, you angel! What do I do with them?"</p>

<p>"Stick them on Jane," I said grandly. "Dot them
about the house. Stamp your letters with them&mdash;I
can always get you plenty more."</p>

<p>"Didn't you get a card too?"</p>

<p>"N-no. No, I didn't. The fact is, it's your turn
now, Celia. <i>You</i> get the card."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right. I&mdash;er&mdash;suppose you just ask for a&mdash;a
card?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. And&mdash;er&mdash;choose a doctor, and&mdash;er&mdash;decide
on an approved society, and&mdash;er&mdash;explain
why it is you hadn't got a card before, and&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash; Well,
anyhow, it's your turn now, Celia."</p>

<p>"It's really still Jane's turn," said Celia, "only she's
so stupid about it."</p>

<p>But she turned out to be not so stupid as we thought.
For yesterday there came a ring at the bell. Feeling
instinctively that it was the inspector, Celia and I got
behind the sofa ... and emerged some minutes later
to find Jane alone in the room.</p>

<p>"Somebody come to see about an insurance card or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
something," she said. "I said you were both out, and
would he come to-morrow."</p>

<p>Technically I suppose we <i>were</i> both out. That is, we
were not receiving.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jane," I said stiffly. I turned to
Celia. "There you are," I said. "To-morrow something
<i>must</i> be done."</p>

<p>"I always said I'd do it to-morrow," said Celia.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="SILVER_LININGS" id="SILVER_LININGS"></a>SILVER LININGS</h3>

<p class="cap">"<span class="dcap">We</span> want some more coal," said Celia suddenly
at breakfast.</p>

<p>"Sorry," I said, engrossed in my paper,
and I passed her the marmalade.</p>

<p>"More coal," she repeated.</p>

<p>I pushed across the toast.</p>

<p>Celia sighed and held up her hand.</p>

<p>"Please may I speak to you a moment?" she said,
trying to snap her fingers. "Good; I've caught his
eye. We want&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry. What is it?"</p>

<p>"We want some more coal. Never mind this once
whether Inman beat Hobbs or not. Just help me."</p>

<p>"Celia, you've been reading the paper," I said in
surprise. "I thought you only read the <i>feuill</i>&mdash;the
serial story. How did you know Inman was playing
Hobbs?"</p>

<p>"Well, Poulton or Carpentier or whoever it is. Look
here, we're out of coal. What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"That's easy. Order some more. What do you do
when you're out of nutmegs?"</p>

<p>"It depends if the nutmeg porters are striking."</p>

<p>"Striking! Good heavens, I never thought about
that." I glanced hastily down the headlines of my
paper. "Celia, this is serious. I shall have to think
about this seriously. Will you order a fire in the library?
I shall retire to the library and think this over."</p>

<p>"You can retire to the library, but you can't have a
fire there. There's only just enough for the kitchen
for two days."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then come and chaperon me in the kitchen. Don't
leave me alone with Jane. You and I and Jane will
assemble round the oven and discuss the matter.
B-r-r-r. It's cold."</p>

<p>"Not the kitchen. I'll assemble with you round the
electric light somewhere. Come on."</p>

<p>We went into the library and rallied round a wax
vesta. It was a terribly cold morning.</p>

<p>"I can't think like this," I said, after fifteen seconds'
reflection. "I'm going to the office. There's a fire
there, anyway."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like a nice secretary," said Celia
timidly, "or an office girl, or somebody to lick the
stamps?"</p>

<p>"I should never do any work if you came," I said,
looking at her thoughtfully. "Do come."</p>

<p>"No, I shall be all right. I've got shopping to do
this morning, and I'm going out to lunch, and I can
pay some calls afterwards."</p>

<p>"Right. And you might find out what other people
are doing, the people you call on. And&mdash;er&mdash;if you
<i>should</i> be left alone in the drawing-room a moment ...
and the coal-box is at all adjacent.... You'll have
your muff with you, you see, and&mdash;&mdash; Well, I leave
that to you. Do what you can."</p>

<p>I had a good day at the office and have never been
so loth to leave. I always felt I should get to like my
work some time. I arrived home again about six.
Celia was a trifle later, and I met her on the mat as she
came in.</p>

<p>"Any luck?" I asked eagerly, feeling in her muff.
"Dash it, Celia, there are nothing but hands here.
Do you mean to say you didn't pick up anything
at all?"</p>

<p>"Only information," she said, leading the way into
the drawing-room. "Hallo, what's this? A fire!"</p>

<p>"A small involuntary contribution from the office.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
I brought it home under my hat. Well, what's the
news?"</p>

<p>"That if we want any coal we shall have to fetch it
ourselves. And we can get it in small amounts from
greengrocers. Why greengrocers, I don't know."</p>

<p>"I suppose they have to have fires to force the
cabbages. But what about the striking coal porters?
If you do their job, won't they picket you or pickaxe
you or something?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, I should hate to go alone. But I
shall be all right if you come with me."</p>

<p>Celia's faith in me is very touching. I am not quite
so confident about myself. No doubt I could protect
her easily against five or six great brawny hulking
porters ... armed with coal-hammers ... but I am
seriously doubtful whether a dozen or so, aided with a
little luck, mightn't get the better of me.</p>

<p>"Don't let us be rash," I said thoughtfully. "Don't
let us infuriate them."</p>

<p>"You aren't afraid of a striker?" asked Celia in
amazement.</p>

<p>"Of an ordinary striker, no. In a strike of bank-clerks,
or&mdash;or chess-players, or professional skeletons,
I should be a lion among the blacklegs; but there is
something about the very word coal porter which&mdash;&mdash; You
know, I really think this is a case where the British
Army might help us. We have been very good to it."</p>

<p>The British Army, I should explain, has been walking
out with Jane lately. When we go away for week-ends
we let the British Army drop in to supper. Luckily
it neither smokes nor drinks nor takes any great interest
in books. It is a great relief, on your week-ends in the
country, to <i>know</i> that the British Army is dropping in
to supper, when otherwise you might only have suspected
it. I may say that we are rather hoping to get
a position in the Army Recruiting film on the strength
of this hospitality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let the British Army go," I said. "We've been
very kind to him."</p>

<p>"I fancy Jane has left the service. I don't know
why."</p>

<p>"Probably they quarrelled because she gave him
caviare two nights running," I said. "Well, I suppose
I shall have to go. But it will be no place for women.
To-morrow afternoon I will sally forth alone to do it.
But," I added, "I shall probably return with two coal
porters clinging round my neck. Order tea for three."</p>

<p>Next evening, after a warm and busy day at the
office, I put on my top-hat and tail-coat and went out.
If there was any accident I was determined to be
described in the papers as "the body of a well-dressed
man"; to go down to history as "the remains of a
shabbily dressed individual" would be too depressing.
Beautifully clothed, I jumped into a taxi and drove to
Celia's greengrocer. Celia herself was keeping warm by
paying still more calls.</p>

<p>"I want," I said nervously, "a hundredweight of
coal and a cauliflower." This was my own idea. I
intended to place the cauliflower on the top of a sack,
and so to deceive any too-inquisitive coal porter. "No,
no," I should say, "not coal; nice cauliflowers for
Sunday's dinner."</p>

<p>"Can't deliver the coal," said the greengrocer.</p>

<p>"I'm going to take it with me," I explained.</p>

<p>He went round to a yard at the back. I motioned
my taxi along and followed him at the head of three
small boys who had never seen a top-hat and a cauliflower
so close together. We got the sack into position.</p>

<p>"Come, come," I said to the driver, "haven't you
ever seen a dressing-case before? Give us a hand with
it or I shall miss my train and be late for dinner."</p>

<p>He grinned and gave a hand. I paid the greengrocer,
pressed the cauliflower into the hand of the smallest
boy, and drove off....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>It was absurdly easy.</p>

<p>There was no gore at all.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>"There!" I said to Celia when she came back.
"And when that's done I'll get you some more."</p>

<p>"Hooray! And yet," she went on, "I'm almost
sorry. You see, I was working off my calls so nicely,
and you'd been having some quite busy days at the
office, hadn't you?"</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="THE_ORDER_OF_THE_BATH" id="THE_ORDER_OF_THE_BATH"></a>THE ORDER OF THE BATH</h3>

<p class="cap">"<span class="dcap">We</span> must really do something about the
bath," said Celia.</p>

<p>"We must," I agreed.</p>

<p>At present what we do is this. Punctually at six-thirty
or nine, or whenever it is, Celia goes in to make
herself clean and beautiful for the new day, while I
amuse myself with a razor. After a quarter of an hour
or so she gives a whistle to imply that the bathroom
is now vacant, and I give another one to indicate that
I have only cut myself once. I then go hopefully in
and find that the bath is half full of water; whereupon
I go back to my room and engage in Dr. Hugh de
S&eacute;lincourt's physical exercises for the middle-aged.
After these are over I take another look at the bath,
discover that it is now three-eighths full, and return
to my room and busy myself with Dr. Archibald
Marshall's mental drill for busy men. By the time I
have committed three Odes of Horace to memory, it
may be low tide or it may not; if not, I sit on the edge
of the bath with the daily paper and read about the
latest strike&mdash;my mind occupied equally with wondering
when the water is going out and when the bricklayers
are. And the thought that Celia is now in the
dining-room eating more than her share of the toast
does not console me in the least.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "it's absurd to go on like this. You
had better see about it to-day, Celia."</p>

<p>"I don't think&mdash;I mean, I think&mdash;you know, it's
really <i>your</i> turn to do something for the bathroom."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, <i>my</i> turn? Didn't I buy the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
glass shelves for it? You'd never even heard of glass
shelves."</p>

<p>"Well, who put them up after they'd been lying
about for a month?" said Celia. "I did."</p>

<p>"And who bumped his head against them the next
day? I did."</p>

<p>"Yes, but that wasn't really a <i>useful</i> thing to do.
It's your turn to be useful."</p>

<p>"Celia, this is mutiny. All household matters are
supposed to be looked after by you. I do the brain
work; I earn the money; I cannot be bothered with
these little domestic worries. I have said so before."</p>

<p>"I sort of thought you had."</p>

<p>You know, I am afraid that is true.</p>

<p>"After all," she went on, "the drinks are in your
department."</p>

<p>"Hock, perhaps," I said; "soapy water, no. There
is a difference."</p>

<p>"Not very much," said Celia.</p>

<p>By the end of another week I was getting seriously
alarmed. I began to fear that unless I watched it very
carefully I should be improving myself too much.</p>

<p>"While the water was running out this morning,"
I said to Celia, as I started my breakfast just about
lunch-time, "I got <i>Paradise Lost</i> off by heart, and
made five hundred and ninety-six revolutions with the
back paws. And then it was time to shave myself
again. What a life for a busy man!"</p>

<p>"I don't know if you know that it's no&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Begin again," I said.</p>

<p>"&mdash;that it's no good waiting for the last inch or
two to go out by itself. Because it won't. You have
to&mdash;to <i>hoosh</i> it out."</p>

<p>"I do. And I sit on the taps looking like a full moon
and try to draw it out. But it's no good. We had a
neap tide to-day and I had to hoosh four inches.
Jolly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Celia gave a sigh of resignation.</p>

<p>"All right," she said, "I'll go to the plumber to-day."</p>

<p>"Not the plumber," I begged. "On the contrary.
The plumber is the man who <i>stops</i> the leaks. What we
really want is an unplumber."</p>

<p>We fell into silence again.</p>

<p>"But how silly we are!" cried Celia suddenly.
"Of course!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?"</p>

<p>"The bath is the <i>landlord's</i> business! Write and
tell him."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but what shall I say?" Somehow I knew
Celia would put it on to me.</p>

<p>"Why, just&mdash;<i>say</i>. When you're paying the rent,
you know."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I see."</p>

<p>I retired to the library and thought it out. I hate
writing business letters. The result is a mixture of
formality and chattiness which seems to me all wrong.</p>

<p>My first letter to the landlord went like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I enclose cheque in payment of last
quarter's rent. Our bath won't run out properly.
Yours faithfully."</p>

<p>It is difficult to say just what is wrong with that
letter, and yet it is obvious that something has happened
to it. It isn't <i>right</i>. I tried again.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Enclosed please find cheque in payment
of enclosed account. I must ask you either to
enlarge the exit to our bath or to supply an emergency
door. At present my morning and evening baths are
in serious danger of clashing. Yours faithfully."</p>

<p>My third attempt had more sting in it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Unless you do something to our bath
I cannot send you enclosed cheque in payment of enclosed
account. Otherwise I would have. Yours
faithfully."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>At this point I whistled to Celia and laid the letters
before her.</p>

<p>"You see what it is," I said. "I'm not quite getting
the note."</p>

<p>"But you're so abrupt," she said. "You must
remember that this is all coming quite as a surprise to
him. You want to lead up to it more gradually."</p>

<p>"Ah, perhaps you're right. Let's try again."</p>

<p>I tried again, with this result:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;In sending you a cheque in payment
of last quarter's rent I feel I must tell you how comfortable
we are here. The only inconvenience&mdash;and
it is indeed a trifling one, dear Sir&mdash;which we have
experienced is in connection with the bathroom.
Elegantly appointed and spacious as this room is,
commodious as we find the actual bath itself, yet we
feel that in the matter of the waste-pipe the high
standard of efficiency so discernible elsewhere is sadly
lacking. Were I alone I should not complain; but
unfortunately there are two of us; and, for the second
one, the weariness of waiting while the waters of the
first bath exude drop by drop is almost more than can
be borne. I speak with knowledge, for it is I who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I tore the letter up and turned to Celia.</p>

<p>"I'm a fool," I said. "I've just thought of something
which will save me all this rotten business every
morning."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course&mdash;in future <i>I</i> will go to the bath
first."</p>

<p>And I do. It is a ridiculously simple solution, and
I cannot think why it never occurred to me before.</p>

<h3><a name="A_TRUNK_CALL" id="A_TRUNK_CALL"></a>A TRUNK CALL</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Last</span> Wednesday, being the anniversary of the
Wednesday before, Celia gave me a present
of a door-knocker. The knocker was in the
shape of an elephant's head (not life-size); and by
bumping the animal's trunk against his chin you could
produce a small brass noise.</p>

<p>"It's for the library," she explained eagerly.
"You're going to work there this morning, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall be very busy," I said in my busy voice.</p>

<p>"Well, just put it up before you start, and then if
I <i>have</i> to interrupt you for anything important, I can
knock with it. <i>Do</i> say you love it."</p>

<p>"It's a dear, and so are you. Come along, let's put
it up."</p>

<p>I got a small screw-driver, and with very little loss
of blood managed to screw it into the door. Some
people are born screwists, some are not. I am one of
the nots.</p>

<p>"It's rather sideways," said Celia doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Osso erry," I said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>I took my knuckle from my mouth.</p>

<p>"Not so very," I repeated.</p>

<p>"I wish it had been straight."</p>

<p>"So do I; but it's too late now. You have to leave
these things very largely to the screw-driver. Besides,
elephants often do have their heads sideways; I've
noticed it at the Zoo."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind. I think it's very clever of you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to do it at all. Now then, you go in, and I'll knock and
see if you hear."</p>

<p>I went in and shut the door, Celia remaining outside.
After five seconds, having heard nothing, but not
wishing to disappoint her, I said, "Come in," in the
voice of one who has been suddenly disturbed by a
loud "rat-tat."</p>

<p>"I haven't knocked yet," said Celia from the other
side of the door.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I was admiring him. He <i>is</i> jolly. Do come and
look at him again."</p>

<p>I went out and looked at him again. He really gave
an air to the library door.</p>

<p>"His face is rather dirty," said Celia. "I think he
wants some brass polish and a&mdash;and a bun."</p>

<p>She ran off to the kitchen. I remained behind with
Jumbo and had a little practice. The knock was not
altogether convincing, owing to the fact that his chin
was too receding for his trunk to get at it properly.
I could hear it quite easily on my own side of the door,
but I felt rather doubtful whether the sound would
penetrate into the room. The natural noise of the
elephant&mdash;roar, bark, whistle, or whatever it is&mdash;I
have never heard, but I am told it is very terrible to
denizens of the jungle. Jumbo's cry would not have
alarmed an ant.</p>

<p>Celia came back with flannels and things and washed
Jumbo's face.</p>

<p>"There!" she said. "Now his mother would love
him again." Very confidently she propelled his trunk
against his chin and added, "Come in."</p>

<p>"You can hear it quite plainly," I said quickly.</p>

<p>"It doesn't re&mdash;rever&mdash;reverberate&mdash;is that the
word?" said Celia, "but it's quite a distinctive noise.
I'm sure you'd hear it."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I should. Let's try."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not now. I'll try later on, when you aren't expecting
it. Besides, you must begin your work. Good-bye.
Work hard." She pushed me in and shut the door.</p>

<p>I began to work.</p>

<p>I work best on the sofa; I think most clearly in what
appears to the hasty observer to be an attitude of rest.
But I am not sure that Celia really understands this
yet. Accordingly, when a knock comes at the door I
jump to my feet, ruffle my hair, and stride up and
down the room with one hand on my brow. "Come
in," I call impatiently, and Celia finds me absolutely
in the throes. If there should chance to be a second
knock later on, I make a sprint for the writing-desk,
seize pen and paper, upset the ink or not as it happens,
and present to any one coming in at the door the most
thoroughly engrossed back in London.</p>

<p>But that was in the good old days of knuckle-knocking.
On this particular morning I had hardly
written more than a couple of thousand words&mdash;I mean
I had hardly got the cushions at the back of my head
comfortably settled when Celia came in.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said eagerly.</p>

<p>I struggled out of the sofa.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked sternly.</p>

<p>"Did you hear it all right?"</p>

<p>"I didn't hear anything."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said in great disappointment. "But
perhaps you were asleep," she went on hopefully.</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I was working."</p>

<p>"Did I interrupt you?"</p>

<p>"You did rather; but it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I won't do it again&mdash;unless I really have
to. Good-bye, and good luck."</p>

<p>She went out and I returned to my sofa. After an
hour or so my mind began to get to work, and I got
up and walked slowly up and down the room. The
gentle exercise seemed to stimulate me. Seeing my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
new putter in the corner of the room, I took it up (my
brain full of other things) and, dropping a golf ball on
the carpet, began to practise. After five or ten minutes,
my ideas being now quite clear, I was just about to
substitute the pen for the putter when Celia came in.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said. "Are&mdash;are you busy?"</p>

<p>I turned round from a difficult putt with the club
in my hand.</p>

<p>"Very," I said. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to disturb you if you're working&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"But I just wondered if you&mdash;if you liked artichokes."</p>

<p>I looked at her coldly.</p>

<p>"I will fill in your confession book another time,"
I said stiffly, and I sat down with dignity at my desk
and dipped the putter in the ink.</p>

<p>"It's for dinner to-night," said Celia persuasively.
"Do say. Because I don't want to eat them all by
myself."</p>

<p>I saw that I should have to humour her.</p>

<p>"If it's a Jerusalem artichoke you mean, yes," I
said; "the other sort, no. J. Arthur Choke I love."</p>

<p>"Right-o. Sorry for interrupting." And then as
she went to the door, "You <i>did</i> hear Jumbo this time,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I believe that's the only reason you came in for."</p>

<p>"Well, one of them."</p>

<p>"Are you coming in again?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," she smiled. "Depends if I can
think of an excuse."</p>

<p>"Right," I said. "In that case&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was nothing else for it; I took up my pen
and began to work.</p>

<p>But I have a suggestion to make to Celia. At present,
although Jumbo is really mine, <i>she</i> is having all the
fun with him. And as long as Jumbo is on the outside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of the door there can never rise an occasion when I
should want to use him. My idea is that I should
unscrew Jumbo and put him on the <i>inside</i> of the door,
so that I can knock when I come out.</p>

<p>And then when Celia wants to come in she will warn
me in the old-fashioned way with her knuckles ...
and I shall have time to do something about it.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_PARTING_GUEST" id="THE_PARTING_GUEST"></a>THE PARTING GUEST</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">When</span> nice people ask me to their houses
for the week-end, I reply that I shall be
delighted to come, but that pressure of
work will prevent my staying beyond Tuesday. Sometimes,
in spite of this, they try to kick me out on the
Monday; and if I find that they are serious about it
I may possibly consent to go by an evening train. In
any case, it always seems to me a pity to have to leave
a house just as you are beginning to know your way
to the bathroom.</p>

<p>"Is the 9.25 too early for you?" said Charles on
Sunday night <i>&agrave; propos</i> of nothing that I had said.</p>

<p>"Not if it's in the evening," I answered.</p>

<p>"It's in the morning."</p>

<p>"Then it's much too early. I never travel before
breakfast. But why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've got to ride over to Newtown to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To-morrow?" I said in surprise. "Aren't we
talking about Tuesday?"</p>

<p>It appeared that we weren't. It also came out that
Charles and his wife, not anticipating the pleasure of
my company beyond Monday, had arranged to ride
over the downs to Newtown to inspect a horse. They
would not be back until the evening.</p>

<p>"But that's all right, Charles," I said. "If you
have a spare horse, a steady one which doesn't wobble
when it canters, I will ride with you."</p>

<p>"There's only the old pony," said Charles, "and
he will be wanted to drive you to the station."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not until Tuesday," I pointed out.</p>

<p>Charles ignored this remark altogether.</p>

<p>"You couldn't ride Joseph, anyway," he said.</p>

<p>"Then I might run beside you, holding on to your
stirrup. My ancestors always went into battle like
that. We are still good runners."</p>

<p>Charles turned over some more pages of his timetable.</p>

<p>"There is a 10.41," he announced.</p>

<p>"Just when I shall be getting to like you," I sighed.</p>

<p>"Molly and I have to be off by ten. If you caught
the 10.41, you would want to leave here by a quarter
past."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't <i>want</i> to leave," I said reproachfully;
"I should go with the greatest regret."</p>

<p>"The 9.25, of course, gets you up to town much
earlier."</p>

<p>"Some such idea, no doubt, would account for its
starting before the 10.41. What have you at about
4.30?"</p>

<p>"If you don't mind changing at Plimton, there's a
10.5&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I got up and lit my candle.</p>

<p>"Let's wait till to-morrow and see what the weather's
like," I said sleepily. "I am not a proud man, but
after what you've said, and if it's at all wet, I may
actually be glad to catch an early train." And I
marched upstairs to bed.</p>

<p>However, a wonderful blue sky next morning made
any talk of London utterly offensive. My host and
hostess had finished breakfast by the time I got down,
and I was just beginning my own when the sound of
the horses on the gravel brought me out.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry we've got to dash off like this," said
Mrs. Charles, smiling at me from the back of Pompey.
"Don't you be in any hurry to go. There are plenty
of trains."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you. It would be a shame to leave the
country on a morning like this, wouldn't it? I shall
take a stroll over the hills before lunch, and sit about
in the garden in the afternoon. There's a train at five,
I think."</p>

<p>"We shan't be back by then, I'm afraid, so this will
be good-bye."</p>

<p>I made my farewells, and Pompey, who was rather
fresh, went off sideways down the drive. This left me
alone with Charles.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Charles," I said, patting him with one
hand and his horse with the other. "Don't you bother
about me. I shall be quite happy by myself."</p>

<p>He looked at me with a curious smile and was
apparently about to say something, when C&aelig;sar suddenly
caught sight of my stockings. These, though
in reality perfectly tasteful, might well come as a surprise
to a young horse, and C&aelig;sar bolted down the
drive to tell Pompey about it. I waved to them all
from the distance and returned to my breakfast.</p>

<p>After breakfast I lit a pipe and strolled outside. As
I stood at the door drinking in the beauty of the morning
I was the victim of a curious illusion. It seemed
to me that outside the front door was the pony-cart&mdash;Joseph
in the shafts, the gardener's boy holding the
reins, and by the side of the boy my bag!</p>

<p>"We'll only just have time, sir," said the boy.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but I'm going by the five train," I stammered.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I shall be over at Newtown this afternoon&mdash;with
the cart."</p>

<p>I did not like to ask him why, but I thought I knew.
It was, I told myself, to fetch back the horse
which Charles was going over to inspect, the horse
to which I had to give up my room that night.</p>

<p>"Very well," I said. "Take the bag now and leave
it in the cloak-room. I'll walk in later." What the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
etiquette was when your host gave you a hint by sending
your bag to the station and going away himself,
I did not know. But however many bags he packed
and however many horses he inspected, I was not to
be moved till the five o'clock train.</p>

<p>Half an hour after my bag was gone I made a discovery.
It was that, when I started walking to the
five o'clock train, I should have to start in pumps....</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>"My dear Charles," I wrote that night, "it was
delightful to see you this week-end, and I only wish
I could have stayed with you longer, but, as you know,
I had to dash up to town by the five train to inspect
a mule. I am sorry to say that a slight accident
happened just before I left you. In the general way,
when I catch an afternoon train, I like to pack my
bag overnight, but on this occasion I did not begin
until nine in the morning. This only left me eight
hours, and the result was that in my hurry I packed
my shoes by mistake, and had to borrow a pair of yours
in which to walk to the station. <i>I will bring them down
with me next time I come.</i>"</p>

<p>I may say that they are unusually good shoes, and
if Charles doesn't want me he must at least want them.
So I am expecting another invitation by every post.
When it arrives I shall reply that I shall be delighted
to come, but that, alas! pressure of work will prevent
my staying beyond Tuesday.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_LANDSCAPE_GARDENER" id="THE_LANDSCAPE_GARDENER"></a>THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Really</span> I know nothing about flowers. By a
bit of luck, James, my gardener, whom I pay
half a crown a week for combing the beds,
knows nothing about them either; so my ignorance
remains undiscovered. But in other people's gardens
I have to make something of an effort to keep up
appearances. Without flattering myself I may say
that I have acquired a certain manner; I give the
impression of the garden lover, or the man with shares
in a seed company, or&mdash;or something.</p>

<p>For instance, at Creek Cottage, Mrs. Atherley will
say to me, "That's an <i>Amphilobertus Gemini</i>," pointing
to something which I hadn't noticed behind a
rake.</p>

<p>"I am not a bit surprised," I say calmly.</p>

<p>"And a <i>Gladiophinium Banksii</i> next to it."</p>

<p>"I suspected it," I confess in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>Towards flowers whose names I know I adopt a
different tone.</p>

<p>"Aren't you surprised to see daffodils out so early?"
says Mrs. Atherley with pride.</p>

<p>"There are lots out in London," I mention casually.
"In the shops."</p>

<p>"So there are grapes," says Miss Atherley.</p>

<p>"I was not talking about grapes," I reply stiffly.</p>

<p>However, at Creek Cottage just now I can afford to
be natural; for it is not gardening which comes under
discussion these days, but landscape-gardening, and
any one can be an authority on that. The Atherleys,
fired by my tales of Sandringham, Chatsworth, Arundel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and other places where I am constantly spending the
week-end, are readjusting their two-acre field. In
future it will not be called "the garden," but "the
grounds."</p>

<p>I was privileged to be shown over the grounds on
my last visit to Creek Cottage.</p>

<p>"Here," said Mrs. Atherley, "we are having a plantation.
It will keep the wind off; and we shall often
sit here in the early days of summer. That's a weeping
ash in the middle. There's another one over there.
They'll be lovely, you know."</p>

<p>"What's that?" I asked, pointing to a bit of black
stick on the left; which, even more than the other
trees, gave the impression of having been left there by
the gardener while he went for his lunch.</p>

<p>"That's a weeping willow."</p>

<p>"This is rather a tearful corner of the grounds,"
apologized Miss Atherley. "We'll show you something
brighter directly. Look there&mdash;that's the oak
in which King Charles lay hid. At least, it will be
when it's grown a bit."</p>

<p>"Let's go on to the shrubbery," said Mrs. Atherley.
"We are having a new grass path from here to the
shrubbery. It's going to be called Henry's Walk."</p>

<p>Miss Atherley has a small brother called Henry.
Also there were eight Kings of England called Henry.
Many a time and oft one of those nine Henrys has
paced up and down this grassy walk, his head bent, his
hands clasped behind his back; while behind his
furrowed brow, who shall say what world-schemes
were hatching? Is it the thought of Wolsey which
makes him frown&mdash;or is he wondering where he left
his catapult? Ah! who can tell us? Let us leave a
veil of mystery over it ... for the sake of the next
visitor.</p>

<p>"The shrubbery," said Mrs. Atherley proudly,
waving her hand at a couple of laurel bushes and a&mdash;I've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
forgotten its name now, but it is one of the few
shrubs I really know.</p>

<p>"And if you're a gentleman," said Miss Atherley,
"and want to get asked here again, you'll always <i>call</i>
it the shrubbery."</p>

<p>"Really, I don't see what else you could call it," I
said, wishing to be asked down again.</p>

<p>"The patch."</p>

<p>"True," I said. "I mean, Nonsense."</p>

<p>I was rather late for breakfast next morning; a pity
on such a lovely spring day.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," I began, "but I was looking at the
shrubbery from my window and I quite forgot the
time."</p>

<p>"Good," said Miss Atherley.</p>

<p>"I must thank you for putting me in such a perfect
room for it," I went on, warming to my subject. "One
can actually see the shrubs&mdash;er&mdash;shrubbing. The
plantation, too, seems a little thicker to me than
yesterday."</p>

<p>"I expect it is."</p>

<p>"In fact, the tennis lawn&mdash;&mdash;" I looked round
anxiously. I had a sudden fear that it might be the
new deer-park. "It still is the tennis lawn?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. Why, what about it?"</p>

<p>"I was only going to say the tennis lawn had quite
a lot of shadows on it. Oh, there's no doubt that the
plantation is really asserting itself."</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock found me strolling in the grounds
with Miss Atherley.</p>

<p>"You know," I said, as we paced Henry's Walk
together, "the one thing the plantation wants is for a
bird to nest in it. That is the hall-mark of a plantation."</p>

<p>"It's mother's birthday to-morrow. Wouldn't it be
a lovely surprise for her?"</p>

<p>"It would, indeed. Unfortunately this is a matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
in which you require the co-operation of a feathered
friend."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you try to persuade a bird to build a nest
in the weeping ash? Just for this once?"</p>

<p>"You're asking me a very difficult thing," I said
doubtfully. "Anything else I would do cheerfully
for you; but to dictate to a bird on such a very domestic
affair&mdash;&mdash; No, I'm afraid I must refuse."</p>

<p>"It need only just <i>begin</i> to build one," pleaded Miss
Atherley, "because mother's going up to town by your
train to-morrow. As soon as she's out of the house
the bird can go back anywhere else it likes better."</p>

<p>"I will put that to any bird I see to-day," I said,
"but I am doubtful."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," sighed Miss Atherley, "never mind."</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>"What do you think?" cried Mrs. Atherley as she
came in to breakfast next day. "There's a bird been
nesting in the plantation!"</p>

<p>Miss Atherley looked at me in undisguised admiration.
I looked quite surprised&mdash;I know I did.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" I said.</p>

<p>"You must come out afterwards and see the nest
and tell me what bird it is. There are three eggs in it.
I am afraid I don't know much about these things."</p>

<p>"I'm glad," I said thankfully. "I mean, I shall be
glad to."</p>

<p>We went out eagerly after breakfast. On about the
only tree in the plantation with a fork to it a nest
balanced precariously. It had in it three pale-blue eggs
splotched with light brown. It appeared to be a blackbird's
nest with another egg or two to come.</p>

<p>"It's been very quick about it," said Miss Atherley.</p>

<p>"Of our feathered bipeds," I said, frowning at her,
"the blackbird is notoriously the most hasty."</p>

<p>"Isn't it lovely?" said Mrs. Atherley.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>She was still talking about it as she climbed into the
trap which was to take us to the station.</p>

<p>"One moment," I said, "I've forgotten something."
I dashed into the house and out by a side door, and
then sprinted for the plantation. I took the nest from
the weeping and over-weighted ash and put it carefully
back in the hedge by the tennis-lawn. Then I returned
more leisurely to the house.</p>

<p>If you ever want a job of landscape-gardening
thoroughly well done, you can always rely upon me.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_SAME_OLD_STORY" id="THE_SAME_OLD_STORY"></a>THE SAME OLD STORY</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">We</span> stood in a circle round the parrot's cage
and gazed with interest at its occupant.
She (Evangeline) was balancing easily on
one leg, while with the other leg and her beak she tried
to peel a monkey-nut. There are some of us who hate
to be watched at meals, particularly when dealing
with the dessert, but Evangeline is not of our number.</p>

<p>"There," said Mrs. Atherley, "isn't she a beauty?"</p>

<p>I felt that, as the last to be introduced, I ought to
say something.</p>

<p>"What do you say to a parrot?" I whispered to
Miss Atherley.</p>

<p>"Have a banana," suggested Reggie.</p>

<p>"I believe you say, 'Scratch-a-poll,'" said Miss
Atherley, "but I don't know why."</p>

<p>"Isn't that rather dangerous? Suppose it retorted
'Scratch your own,' I shouldn't know a bit how to
go on."</p>

<p>"It can't talk," said Reggie. "It's quite a baby&mdash;only
seven months old. But it's no good showing it
your watch; you must think of some other way of
amusing it."</p>

<p>"Break it to me, Reggie. Have I been asked down
solely to amuse the parrot, or did any of you others
want to see me?"</p>

<p>"Only the parrot," said Reggie.</p>

<p>Evangeline paid no attention to us. She continued
to wrestle with the monkey-nut. I should say that she
was a bird not easily amused.</p>

<p>"Can't it really talk at all?" I asked Mrs. Atherley.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not yet. You see, she's only just come over from
South America, and isn't used to the climate yet."</p>

<p>"But that's just the person you'd expect to talk a
lot about the weather. I believe you've been had.
Write a little note to the poulterers and ask if you can
change it. You've got a bad one by mistake."</p>

<p>"We got it as a bird," said Mrs. Atherley with dignity,
"not as a gramophone."</p>

<p>The next morning Evangeline was as silent as ever.
Miss Atherley and I surveyed it after breakfast. It was
still grappling with a monkey-nut, but no doubt a
different one.</p>

<p>"Isn't it <i>ever</i> going to talk?" I asked. "Really, I
thought parrots were continually chatting."</p>

<p>"Yes, but they have to be taught&mdash;just like you
teach a baby."</p>

<p>"Are you sure? I quite see that you have to teach
them any special things you want them to say, but I
thought they were all born with a few simple obvious
remarks, like 'Poor Polly,' or&mdash;or 'Dash Lloyd
George.'"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Miss Atherley. "Not the
green ones."</p>

<p>At dinner that evening, Mr. Atherley being now with
us, the question of Evangeline's education was seriously
considered.</p>

<p>"The only proper method," began Mr. Atherley&mdash;&mdash;"By
the way," he said, turning to me, "you don't
know anything about parrots, do you?"</p>

<p>"No," I said. "You can go on quite safely."</p>

<p>"The only proper method of teaching a parrot&mdash;I
got this from a man in the City this morning&mdash;is to
give her a word at a time, and to go on repeating it
over and over again until she's got hold of it."</p>

<p>"And after that the parrot goes on repeating it
over and over again until you've got sick of it," said
Reggie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we shall have to be very careful what word
we choose," said Mrs. Atherley.</p>

<p>"What is your favourite word?"</p>

<p>"Well, really&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Animal, vegetable, or mineral?" asked Archie.</p>

<p>"This is quite impossible. Every word by itself
seems so silly."</p>

<p>"Not 'home' and 'mother,'" I said reproachfully.</p>

<p>"You shall recite your little piece in the drawing-room
afterwards," said Miss Atherley to me. "Think
of something sensible now."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Atherley. "What's the latest
word from London?"</p>

<p>"Kikuyu."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I can't say it again," I protested.</p>

<p>"If you can't even say it twice, it's no good for
Evangeline."</p>

<p>A thoughtful silence fell upon us.</p>

<p>"Have you fixed on a name for her yet?" Miss
Atherley asked her mother.</p>

<p>"Evangeline, of course."</p>

<p>"No, I mean a name for her to call <i>you</i>. Because if
she's going to call you 'Auntie' or 'Darling,' or whatever
you decide on, you'd better start by teaching her
that."</p>

<p>And then I had a brilliant idea.</p>

<p>"I've got the very word," I said. "It's 'hallo.'
You see, it's a pleasant form of greeting to any stranger,
and it will go perfectly with the next word that she's
taught, whatever it may be."</p>

<p>"Supposing it's 'wardrobe,'" suggested Reggie,
"or 'sardine'?"</p>

<p>"Why not? 'Hallo, Sardine' is the perfect title
for a <i>revue</i>. Witty, subtle, neat&mdash;probably the great
brain of the Revue King has already evolved it, and is
planning the opening scene."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, 'hallo' isn't at all bad," said Mr. Atherley.
"Anyway, it's better than 'Poor Polly,' which is
simply morbid. Let's fix on 'hallo.'"</p>

<p>"Good," said Mrs. Atherley.</p>

<p>Evangeline said nothing, being asleep under her
blanket.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>I was down first next morning, having forgotten to
wind up my watch overnight. Longing for company,
I took the blanket off Evangeline's cage and introduced
her to the world again. She stirred sleepily, opened her
eyes and blinked at me.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Evangeline," I said.</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>Suddenly a splendid scheme occurred to me. I would
teach Evangeline her word now. How it would surprise
the others when they came down and said "Hallo"
to her, to find themselves promptly answered back!</p>

<p>"Evangeline," I said, "listen. Hallo, hallo, hallo,
hallo." I stopped a moment and went on more slowly.
"Hallo&mdash;hallo&mdash;hallo."</p>

<p>It was dull work.</p>

<p>"Hallo," I said, "hallo&mdash;hallo&mdash;hallo," and then
very distinctly, "Hal-<i>lo</i>."</p>

<p>Evangeline looked at me with an utterly bored face.</p>

<p>"Hallo," I said, "hallo&mdash;hallo."</p>

<p>She picked up a monkey-nut and ate it languidly.</p>

<p>"Hallo," I went on, "hallo, hallo ... hallo, <i>hallo</i>,
<span class="smcapl">HALLO</span>, HALLO ... hallo, hallo&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She dropped her nut and roused herself for a moment.</p>

<p>"Number engaged," she snapped, and took another
nut.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>You needn't believe this. The others didn't when I
told them.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_SPREADING_WALNUT_TREE" id="THE_SPREADING_WALNUT_TREE"></a>THE SPREADING WALNUT TREE</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">We</span> were having breakfast in the garden with
the wasps, and Peter was enlarging on the
beauties of the country round his new week-end
cottage.</p>

<p>"Then there's Hilderton," he said; "that's a lovely
little village, I'm told. We might explore it to-morrow."</p>

<p>Celia woke up suddenly.</p>

<p>"Is Hilderton near here?" she asked in surprise.
"But I often stayed there when I was a child."</p>

<p>"This was years ago, when Edward the Seventh was
on the throne," I explained to Mrs. Peter.</p>

<p>"My grandfather," went on Celia, "lived at Hilderton
Hall."</p>

<p>There was an impressive silence.</p>

<p>"You see the sort of people you're entertaining,"
I said airily to Peter. "My wife's grandfather lived
at Hilderton Hall. Celia, you should have spoken
about this before. It would have done us a lot of good
in Society." I pushed my plate away. "I can't go on
eating bacon after this. Bring me peaches."</p>

<p>"I should love to see it again."</p>

<p>"If I'd had my rights," I said, "I should be living
there now. I must put my solicitor on to this. There's
been foul play somewhere."</p>

<p>Peter looked up from one of the maps which, being
new to the country, he carries with him.</p>

<p>"I can't find Hilderton Hall here," he said. "It's
six inches to the mile, so it ought to be marked."</p>

<p>"Celia, our grandfather's name is being aspersed.
Let us look into this."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>We crowded round the map and studied it anxiously.
Hilderton was there, and Hilderton House, but no
Hilderton Hall.</p>

<p>"But it's a great big place," protested Celia.</p>

<p>"I see what it is," I said regretfully. "Celia, you
were young then."</p>

<p>"Ten."</p>

<p>"Ten. And naturally it seemed big to you, just as
Yarrow seemed big to Wordsworth, and a shilling seems
a lot to a baby. But really&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Really," said Peter, "it was semi-detached."</p>

<p>"And your side was called Hilderton Hall and the
other side Hilderton Castle."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it was even called Hilderton Hall,"
said Peter. "It was Hilderton Villa."</p>

<p>"I don't believe she ever had a grandfather at all,"
said Mrs. Peter.</p>

<p>"She must have had a grandfather," I pointed out.
"But I'm afraid he never lived at Hilderton Hall.
This is a great blow to me, and I shall now resume my
bacon."</p>

<p>I drew my plate back and Peter returned his map
to his pocket.</p>

<p>"You're all very funny," said Celia, "but I know it
was Hilderton Hall. I've a good mind to take you there
this morning and show it to you."</p>

<p>"Do," said Peter and I eagerly.</p>

<p>"It's a great big place&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's what we're coming to see," I reminded her.</p>

<p>"Of course they may have sold some of the land, or&mdash;I
mean, I know when I used to stay there it was a&mdash;a
great big place. I can't promise that it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's no good now, Celia," I said sternly. "You
shouldn't have boasted."</p>

<p>Hilderton was four miles off, and we began to
approach it&mdash;Celia palpably nervous&mdash;at about twelve
o'clock that morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you recognizing any of this?" asked Peter.</p>

<p>"N-no. You see I was only about eight&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You <i>must</i> recognise the church," I said, pointing
to it. "If you don't, it proves either that you never
lived at Hilderton or that you never sang in the choir.
I don't know which thought is the more distressing.
Now what about this place? Is this it?"</p>

<p>Celia peered up the drive.</p>

<p>"N-no; at least I don't remember it. I know there
was a walnut tree in front of the house."</p>

<p>"Is that all you remember?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was only about six&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Peter and I both had a slight cough at the same time.</p>

<p>"It's nothing," said Peter, finding Celia's indignant
eye upon him. "Let's go on."</p>

<p>We found two more big houses, but Celia, a little
doubtfully, rejected them both.</p>

<p>"My grandfather-in-law was very hard to please,"
I apologized to Peter. "He passed over place after
place before he finally fixed on Hilderton Hall. Either
the heronry wasn't ventilated properly, or the decoy
ponds had the wrong kind of mud, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a sudden cry from Celia.</p>

<p>"This is it," she said.</p>

<p>She stood at the entrance to a long drive. A few
chimneys could be seen in the distance. On either side
of the gates was a high wall.</p>

<p>"I don't see the walnut tree," I said.</p>

<p>"Of course not, because you can't see the front of
the house. But I feel certain that this is the place."</p>

<p>"We want more proof than that," said Peter. "We
must go in and find the walnut tree."</p>

<p>"We can't all wander into another man's grounds
looking for walnut trees," I said, "with no better
excuse than that Celia's great-grandmother was once
asked down here for the week-end and stayed for a
fortnight. We&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"My <i>grandfather</i>," said Celia coldly, "<i>lived</i> here."</p>

<p>"Well, whatever it was," I said, "we must invent
a proper reason. Peter, you might pretend you've
come to inspect the gas-meter or the milk or something.
Or perhaps Celia had better disguise herself as a
Suffragette and say that she's come to borrow a box of
matches. Anyhow, one of us must get to the front of
the house to search for this walnut tree."</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it seems rather cheek," said Celia doubtfully.</p>

<p>"We'll toss up who goes."</p>

<p>We tossed, and of course I lost. I went up the drive
nervously. At the first turn I decided to be an insurance
inspector, at the next a scout-master, but, as I
approached the front door, I thought of a very simple
excuse. I rang the bell under the eyes of several
people at lunch and looked about eagerly for the
walnut tree.</p>

<p>There was none.</p>

<p>"Does Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Erasmus&mdash;er&mdash;Percival live here?"
I asked the footman.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he said&mdash;luckily.</p>

<p>"Ah! Was there ever a walnut&mdash;I mean <i>was</i> there
ever a Mr. Percival who lived here? Ah! Thank you,"
and I sped down the drive again.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Celia eagerly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Percival <i>doesn't</i> live there."</p>

<p>"Whoever's Mr. Percival?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot; you don't know him. Friends," I
added solemnly, "I regret to tell you there is <i>no</i> walnut
tree."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised," said Peter.</p>

<p>The walk home was a silent one. For the rest of
the day Celia was thoughtful. But at the end of dinner
she brightened up a little and joined in the conversation.</p>

<p>"At Hilderton Hall," she said suddenly, "we
always&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>"H'r'm," I said, clearing my throat loudly. "Peter,
pass Celia the walnuts."</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>I have had great fun in London this week with the
walnut joke, though Celia says she is getting tired of
it. But I had a letter from Peter to-day which ended
like this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"By the way, I was an ass last week. I took you
to Banfield in mistake for Hilderton. I went to Hilderton
yesterday and found Hilderton Hall&mdash;a large place
<i>with</i> a walnut tree. It's a little way out of the village,
and is marked big on the next section of the map to
the one we were looking at. You might tell Celia."</p></div>

<p>True, I might....</p>

<p>Perhaps in a week or two I shall.</p>

<h3><a name="DEFINITIONS" id="DEFINITIONS"></a>DEFINITIONS</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">As</span> soon as we had joined the ladies after dinner
Gerald took up a position in front of the fire.</p>

<p>"Now that the long winter evenings are upon
us," he began&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Anyhow, it's always dark at half-past nine," said
Norah.</p>

<p>"Not in the morning," said Dennis, who has to be
excused for anything foolish he says since he became
obsessed with golf.</p>

<p>"Please don't interrupt," I begged. "Gerald is
making a speech."</p>

<p>"I was only going to say that we might have a little
game of some sort. Norah, what's the latest parlour
game from London?"</p>

<p>"Tell your uncle," I urged, "how you amuse yourselves
at the Lyceum."</p>

<p>"Do you know 'Hunt the Pencil'?"</p>

<p>"No. What do you do?"</p>

<p>"You collect five pencils; when you've got them,
I'll tell you another game."</p>

<p>"Bother these pencil games," said Dennis, taking an
imaginary swing with a paper-knife. "I hope it isn't
too brainy."</p>

<p>"You'll want to know how to spell," said Norah
severely, and she went to the writing-desk for some
paper.</p>

<p>In a little while&mdash;say, half an hour&mdash;we had each a
sheet of paper and a pencil, and Norah was ready to
explain.</p>

<p>"It's called Definitions. I expect you all know it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>We assured her we didn't.</p>

<p>"Well, you begin by writing down five or six letters,
one underneath the other. We might each suggest one.
'E.'"</p>

<p>We weighed in with ours, and the result was
E P A D U.</p>

<p>"Now you write them backwards."</p>

<p>There was a moment's consternation.</p>

<p>"Like 'bath-mat'?" said Dennis. "An 'e' backwards
looks so silly."</p>

<p>"Stupid&mdash;like this," explained Norah. She showed
us her paper.</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td1">E</td><td class="rgt">U</td></tr>
<tr><td class="td1">P</td><td class="rgt">D</td></tr>

<tr><td class="td1">D</td><td class="rgt">P</td></tr>
<tr><td class="td1">U</td><td class="rgt">E</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>"This is thrilling," said Mrs. Gerald, pencilling hard.</p>

<p>"Then everybody has to fill in words all the way
down, your first word beginning with 'e' and ending
with 'u,' and so on. See?"</p>

<p>Gerald leant over Dennis and explained carefully to
him, and in a little while we all saw.</p>

<p>"Then, when everybody's finished, we define our
words in turn, and the person who guesses a word first
gets a mark. That's all."</p>

<p>"And a very good game too," I said, and I rubbed
my head and began to think.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Norah, after a quarter of an hour's
silence, "you want to make the words difficult and
define them as subtly as possible."</p>

<p>"Of course," I said, wrestling with 'E&mdash;U.' I could
only think of one word, and it was the one everybody
else was certain to have.</p>

<p>"Are we all ready? Then somebody begin."</p>

<p>"You'd better begin, Norah, as you know the game,"
said Mrs. Gerald.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>We prepared to begin.</p>

<p>"Mine," said Norah, "is a bird."</p>

<p>"Emu," we all shouted; but I swear I was first.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't think that's a very subtle definition,"
said Dennis. "You promised to be as subtle as
possible."</p>

<p>"Go on, dear," said Gerald to his wife.</p>

<p>"Well, this is rather awkward. Mine is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Emu," I suggested.</p>

<p>"You must wait till she has defined it," said Norah
sternly.</p>

<p>"Mine is a sort of feathered animal."</p>

<p>"Emu," I said again. In fact, we all said it.</p>

<p>Gerald coughed. "Mine," he said, "isn't exactly a&mdash;fish,
because it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Emu," said everybody.</p>

<p>"That was subtler," said Dennis, "but it didn't
deceive us."</p>

<p>"Your turn," said Norah to me. And they all leant
forward ready to say "Emu."</p>

<p>"Mine," I said, "is&mdash;all right, Dennis, you needn't
look so excited&mdash;is a word I once heard a man say at
the Zoo."</p>

<p>There was a shriek of "Emu!"</p>

<p>"Wrong," I said.</p>

<p>Everybody was silent.</p>

<p>"Where did he say it?" asked Norah at last.
"What was he doing?"</p>

<p>"He was standing outside the Emu's cage."</p>

<p>"It must have been Emu."</p>

<p>"It wasn't."</p>

<p>"Perhaps there's another animal beginning with
'e' and ending with 'u,'" suggested Dennis. "He
might have said,'Look here, I'm tired of this old Emu,
let's go and see the E-doesn't-mu,' or whatever it's
called."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"We shall have to give it up," said Norah at last.
"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Ebu," I announced. "My man had a bad cold,
and he said, 'Look, Baria, there's ad Ebu.' Er&mdash;what
do I get for that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Norah coldly. "It isn't fair. Now,
Mr. Dennis."</p>

<p>"Mine is <i>not</i> Emu, and it couldn't be mistaken for
Emu; not even if you had a sore throat and a sprained
ankle. And it has nothing to do with the Zoo, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"It's what you say at golf when you miss a short
putt."</p>

<p>"I doubt it," I said.</p>

<p>"Not what Gerald says," said his wife.</p>

<p>"Well, it's what you might say. What Horace
would have said."</p>

<p>"'Eheu'&mdash;good," said Gerald, while his wife was
asking "Horace who?"</p>

<p>We moved on to the next word, P&mdash;D.</p>

<p>"Mine," said Norah, "is what you might do to a
man whom you didn't like, but it's a delightful thing
to have and at the same time you would hate to be
in it."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you know what you are talking about,
dear?" said Mrs. Gerald gently.</p>

<p>"Quite," said Norah with the confidence of extreme
youth.</p>

<p>"Could you say it again very slowly," asked
Dennis, "indicating by changes in the voice which
character is speaking?"</p>

<p>She said it again.</p>

<p>"'Pound,'" said Gerald. "Good&mdash;one to me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gerald had "pod," Gerald had "pond"; but
they didn't define them very cleverly and they were
soon guessed. Mine, unfortunately, was also guessed
at once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is what Dennis's golf is," I said.</p>

<p>"'Putrid,'" said Gerald correctly.</p>

<p>"Mine," said Dennis, "is what everybody has two
of."</p>

<p>"Then it's not 'pound,'" I said, "because I've
only got one and ninepence."</p>

<p>"At least, it's best to have two. Sometimes you
lose one. They're very useful at golf. In fact, absolutely
necessary."</p>

<p>"Have you got two?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>I looked at Dennis's enormous hands spread out on
his knees.</p>

<p>"Is it 'pud'?" I asked. "It is? Are those the
two? Good heavens!" and I gave myself a mark.</p>

<p>A&mdash;A was the next, and we had the old Emu
trouble.</p>

<p>"Mine," said Norah&mdash;"mine is rather a meaningless
word."</p>

<p>"'Abracadabra,'" shouted everybody.</p>

<p>"Mine," said Miss Gerald, "is a very strange word,
which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Abracadabra,'" shouted everybody.</p>

<p>"Mine," said Gerald, "is a word which used to
be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Abracadabra,'" shouted everybody.</p>

<p>"Mine," I said to save trouble, "is 'Abracadabra.'"</p>

<p>"Mine," said Dennis, "isn't. It's what you say at
golf when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh lor!" I groaned. "Not again."</p>

<p>"When you hole a long putt for a half."</p>

<p>"You generally say, 'What about <i>that</i> for a good
putt, old thing? Thirty yards at least,'" suggested
Gerald.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;is it 'Alleluia'?" suggested Mrs. Gerald
timidly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Dennis," I said, "you're an ass."</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>"And now," said Norah at the end of the game,
"who's won?"</p>

<p>They counted up their marks.</p>

<p>"Ten," said Norah.</p>

<p>"Fifteen," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"Three," said his wife.</p>

<p>"Fourteen," said Dennis.</p>

<p>They looked at me.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I forgot to put all mine down," I said,
"but I can easily work it out. There were five words,
and five definitions of each word. Twenty-five marks
to be gained altogether. You four have got&mdash;er&mdash;let's
see&mdash;forty-two between you. That leaves me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That leaves you <i>minus</i> seventeen," said Dennis.
"I'm afraid you've lost, old man." He took up the
shovel and practised a few approach shots. "It's
rather a good game."</p>

<p>I think so too. It's a good game, but, like all paper
games, its scoring wants watching.</p>

<h3><a name="A_BILLIARD_LESSON" id="A_BILLIARD_LESSON"></a>A BILLIARD LESSON</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I was</span> showing Celia a few fancy strokes on the
billiard-table. The other members of the house-party
were in the library, learning their parts for
some approaching theatricals&mdash;that is to say, they
were sitting round the fire and saying to each other,
"This <i>is</i> a rotten play." We had been offered the
position of auditors to several of the company, but we
were going to see <i>Parsifal</i> on the next day, and I was
afraid that the constant excitement would be bad for
Celia.</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask me to play with you?" she
asked. "You never teach me anything."</p>

<p>"There's ingratitude. Why, I gave you your first
lesson at golf only last Thursday."</p>

<p>"So you did. I know golf. Now show me billiards."</p>

<p>I looked at my watch.</p>

<p>"We've only twenty minutes. I'll play you thirty
up."</p>

<p>"Right-o. What do you give me&mdash;a ball or a bisque
or what?"</p>

<p>"I can't spare you a ball, I'm afraid. I shall want
all three when I get going. You may have fifteen start,
and I'll tell you what to do."</p>

<p>"Well, what do I do first?"</p>

<p>"Select a cue."</p>

<p>She went over to the rack and inspected them.</p>

<p>"This seems a nice brown one. Now then, you
begin."</p>

<p>"Celia, you've got the half-butt. Put it back and
take a younger one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought it seemed taller than the others." She
took another. "How's this? Good. Then off you
go."</p>

<p>"Will you be spot or plain?" I said, chalking my
cue.</p>

<p>"Does it matter?"</p>

<p>"Not very much. They're both the same shape."</p>

<p>"Then what's the difference?"</p>

<p>"Well, one is more spotted than the other."</p>

<p>"Then I'll be less spotted."</p>

<p>I went to the table.</p>

<p>"I think," I said, "I'll try and screw in off the red."
(I did this once by accident and I've always wanted to
do it again.) "Or perhaps," I corrected myself, as
soon as the ball had left me, "I had better give a
safety miss."</p>

<p>I did. My ball avoided the red and came swiftly
back into the left-hand bottom pocket.</p>

<p>"That's three to you," I said without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Celia seemed surprised.</p>

<p>"But I haven't begun yet," she said. "Well, I
suppose you know the rules, but it seems funny. What
would you like me to do?"</p>

<p>"Well, there isn't much on. You'd better just try
and hit the red ball."</p>

<p>"Right." She leant over the table and took long and
careful aim. I held my breath.... Still she aimed....
Then, keeping her chin on the cue, she slowly
turned her head and looked up at me with a thoughtful
expression.</p>

<p>"Oughtn't there to be three balls on the table?"
she said, wrinkling her forehead.</p>

<p>"No," I answered shortly.</p>

<p>"But why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I went down by mistake."</p>

<p>"But you said that when you got going, you
wanted&mdash;&mdash; I can't argue bending down like this."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
She raised herself slowly. "You said&mdash;&mdash; Oh, all
right, I expect you know. Anyhow, I <i>have</i> scored
some already, haven't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You're eighteen to my nothing."</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, now I shall have to aim all over again."
She bent slowly over her cue. "Does it matter where
I hit the red?"</p>

<p>"Not much. As long as you hit it on the red part."</p>

<p>She hit it hard on the side, and both balls came into
baulk.</p>

<p>"Too good," I said.</p>

<p>"Does either of us get anything for it?"</p>

<p>"No." The red and the white were close together,
and I went up the table and down again on the off-chance
of a cannon. I misjudged it, however.</p>

<p>"That's three to you," I said stiffly, as I took my
ball out of the right-hand bottom pocket. "Twenty-one
to nothing."</p>

<p>"Funny how I'm doing all the scoring," said Celia
meditatively. "And I've practically never played
before. I shall hit the red hard now and see what
happens to it."</p>

<p>She hit, and the red coursed madly about the table,
coming to rest near the top right-hand pocket and
close to the cushion. With a forcing shot I could
get in.</p>

<p>"This will want a lot of chalk," I said pleasantly to
Celia, and gave it plenty. Then I let fly....</p>

<p>"Why did that want a lot of chalk?" said Celia
with interest.</p>

<p>I went to the fire-place and picked my ball out of the
fender.</p>

<p>"That's three to you," I said coldly. "Twenty-four
to nothing."</p>

<p>"Am I winning?"</p>

<p>"You're leading," I explained. "Only, you see, I
may make a twenty at any moment."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" She thought this over. "Well, I may make
my three at any moment."</p>

<p>She chalked her cue and went over to her ball.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Just touch the red on the right-hand side," I said,
"and you'll go into the pocket."</p>

<p>"The <i>right</i>-hand side? Do you mean <i>my</i> right-hand
side, or the ball's?"</p>

<p>"The right-hand side of the ball, of course; that is
to say, the side opposite your right hand."</p>

<p>"But its right-hand side is opposite my <i>left</i> hand,
if the ball is facing this way."</p>

<p>"Take it," I said wearily, "that the ball has its
back to you."</p>

<p>"How rude of it," said Celia, and hit it on the left-hand
side, and sank it. "Was that what you meant?"</p>

<p>"Well ... it's another way of doing it."</p>

<p>"I thought it was. What do I give you for that?"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> get three."</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought the other person always got the
marks. I know the last three times&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on," I said freezingly. "You have another
turn."</p>

<p>"Oh, is it like rounders?"</p>

<p>"Something. Go on, there's a dear. It's getting
late."</p>

<p>She went, and left the red over the middle pocket.</p>

<p>"A-ha!" I said. I found a nice place in the "D"
for my ball. "Now then. This is the Gray stroke,
you know."</p>

<p>I suppose I was nervous. Anyhow, I just nicked
the red ball gently on the wrong side and left it hanging
over the pocket. The white travelled slowly up the
table.</p>

<p>"Why is that called the grey stroke?" asked Celia
with great interest.</p>

<p>"Because once, when Sir Edward Grey was playing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the German Ambassador&mdash;but it's rather a long story.
I'll tell you another time."</p>

<p>"Oh! Well, anyhow, did the German Ambassador
get anything for it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose I don't. Bother."</p>

<p>"But you've only got to knock the red in for game."</p>

<p>"Oh!... There, what's that?"</p>

<p>"That's a miss-cue. I get one."</p>

<p>"Oh!... Oh well," she added magnanimously,
"I'm glad you've started scoring. It will make it
more interesting for you."</p>

<p>There was just room to creep in off the red, leaving
it still over the pocket. With Celia's ball nicely over
the other pocket there was a chance of my twenty
break. "Let's see," I said, "how many do I want?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-nine," replied Celia.</p>

<p>"Ah," I said ... and I crept in.</p>

<p>"That's three to you," I said icily. "Game."</p>

<h4>CHAPTER I</h4>

<h5>PRIMROSE FARM</h5>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Primrose Farm</span> stood slumbering in the
sunlight of an early summer morn. Save for
the gentle breeze which played in the tops of
the two tall elms all Nature seemed at rest. Chanticleer
had ceased his song; the pigs were asleep; in the barn
the cow lay thinking. A deep peace brooded over the
rural scene, the peace of centuries. Terrible to think
that in a few short hours ... but perhaps it won't.
The truth is I have not quite decided whether to have
the murder in this story or in No. XCIX.&mdash;<i>The Severed
Thumb</i>. We shall see.</p>

<p>As her alarum clock (a birthday present) struck five,
Gwendolen French sprang out of bed and plunged her
face into the clump of nettles which grew outside her
lattice window. For some minutes she stood there,
breathing in the incense of the day; then dressing
quickly she went down into the great oak-beamed
kitchen to prepare breakfast for her father and the
pigs. As she went about her simple duties she sang
softly to herself, a song of love and knightly deeds.
Little did she think that a lover, even at that moment,
stood outside her door.</p>

<p>"Heigh-ho!" sighed Gwendolen, and she poured
the bran-mash into a bowl and took it up to her father's
room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>For eighteen years Gwendolen French had been the
daughter of John French of Primrose Farm. Endowed
by Nature with a beauty that is seldom seen
outside this sort of story, she was yet as modest and
as good a girl as was to be found in the county.
Many a fine lady would have given all her Parisian
diamonds for the peach-like complexion which bloomed
on the fair face of Gwendolen. But the gifts of Nature
are not to be bought and sold.</p>

<p>There was a sudden knock at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," cried Gwendolen in surprise. Unless it
was the cow, it was an entirely unexpected visitor.</p>

<p>A tall and handsome young man entered, striking
his head violently against a beam as he stepped into
the low-ceilinged kitchen.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said, repressing the remark
which came more readily to his lips. "Pray forgive
this intrusion. The fact is I have lost my way, and
I wondered whether you would be kind enough to
inform me as to my whereabouts."</p>

<p>Recognizing from his conversation that she was being
addressed by a gentleman, Gwendolen curtsied.</p>

<p>"This is Primrose Farm, sir," she said.</p>

<p>"I fear," he replied with a smile, "it has been my
misfortune never to have heard so charming a name
before. I am Lord Beltravers, of Beltravers Castle,
Beltravers. Having returned last night from India I
came out for an early stroll this morning, and I fear
that I have wandered out of my direction."</p>

<p>"Why," cried Gwendolen, "your lordship is miles
from Beltravers Castle. How tired and hungry you
must be." She removed a lettuce from the kitchen
chair, dusted it, and offered it to him. (That is to say,
the chair, not the lettuce.) "Let me get you some
milk," she added. Picking up a pail, she went out to
inspect the cow.</p>

<p>"Gad," said Lord Beltravers as soon as he was alone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
He paced rapidly up and down the tiled kitchen.
"Deuce take it," he added recklessly, "she's a lovely
girl." The Beltraverses were noted in two continents
for their hard swearing.</p>

<p>"Here you are, sir," said Gwendolen, returning with
the precious liquid.</p>

<p>Lord Beltravers seized the pail and drained it at a
draught.</p>

<p>"Heavens, but that was good!" he said. "What
was it?"</p>

<p>"Milk," said Gwendolen.</p>

<p>"Milk; I must remember. And now may I trespass
on your hospitality still further by trespassing on your
assistance so far as to solicit your help in putting me
far enough on my path to discover my way back to
Beltravers Castle?" (When he was alone he said that
sentence again to himself, and wondered what had
happened to it.)</p>

<p>"I will show you," she said simply.</p>

<p>They passed out into the sunlit orchard. In an
apple tree a thrush was singing; the gooseberries were
over-ripe; beetroots were flowering everywhere.</p>

<p>"You are very beautiful," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gwendolen.</p>

<p>"I must see you again. Listen! To-night my
mother, Lady Beltravers, is giving a ball. Do you
dance?"</p>

<p>"Alas, not the tango," she said sadly.</p>

<p>"The Beltraverses do not tang," he announced with
simple dignity. "You valse? Good. Then will you
come?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, my lord. Oh, I should love to!"</p>

<p>"That is excellent. And now I must bid you good-bye.
But first, will you not tell me your name?"</p>

<p>"Gwendolen French, my lord."</p>

<p>"Ah! One 'f' or two?"</p>

<p>"Three," said Gwendolen simply.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER II</h4>

<h5>BELTRAVERS CASTLE</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Beltravers Castle</span> was a blaze of lights. At the
head of the old oak staircase (a magnificent example of
the Selfridge period) the Lady Beltravers stood receiving
her guests. Magnificently gowned in one of
Sweeting's latest creations, and wearing round her neck
the famous Beltravers seed-pearls, she looked the
picture of stately magnificence. As each guest was
announced by a bevy of footmen, she extended her
perfectly gloved hand and spoke a few words of kindly
welcome.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Duchess; so good of you to look
in. Ah, Earl, charmed to meet you; you'll find some
sandwiches in the billiard-room. Beltravers, show the
Earl some sandwiches. How-do-you-do, Professor?
Delighted you could come. Won't you take off your
goloshes?"</p>

<p>All the county was there.</p>

<p>Lord Hobble was there wearing a magnificent stud;
Erasmus Belt, the famous author, whose novel, <i>Bitten:
A Romance</i>, went into two editions; Sir Septimus
Root, the inventor of the fire-proof spat; Captain the
Honourable Alfred Nibbs, the popular breeder of
blood-tortoises&mdash;the whole world and his wife were
present. And towering above them all stood Lord
Beltravers, of Beltravers Castle, Beltravers.</p>

<p>Lord Beltravers stood aloof in a corner of the great
ball-room. Above his head was the proud coat-of-arms
of the Beltraverses&mdash;a headless sardine on a field of
tomato. As each new arrival entered Lord Beltravers
scanned his or her countenance eagerly, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
turned away with a snarl of disappointment. Would
his little country maid never come?</p>

<p>She came at last. Attired in a frock which had
obviously been created in Little Popley, she looked
the picture of girlish innocence as she stood for a
moment hesitating in the doorway. Then her eyes
brightened as Lord Beltravers came towards her with
long swinging strides.</p>

<p>"You're here!" he exclaimed. "How good of you
to come. I have thought about you ever since this
morning. There is a valse beginning. Will you valse
it with me?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Gwendolen shyly.</p>

<p>Lord Beltravers, who valsed divinely, put his arm
round her waist and led her into the circle of dancers.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
<h4>CHAPTER III</h4>

<h5>AFFIANCED</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ball was at its height. Gwendolen, who had been
in to supper eight times, placed her hand timidly on
the arm of Lord Beltravers, who had just begged a
polka of her.</p>

<p>"Let us sit this out," she said. "Not here&mdash;in the
garden."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lord Beltravers gravely. "Let us go.
I have something to say to you."</p>

<p>Offering her his arm, he led her down the great terrace
which ran along the back of the house.</p>

<p>"How wonderful to have your ancestors always
around you like this!" cooed Gwendolen, as she gazed
with reverence at the two statues which fronted them.</p>

<p>"Venus," said Lord Beltravers shortly, "and
Samson."</p>

<p>He led her down the steps and into the ornamental
garden, and there they sat down.</p>

<p>"Miss French," said Lord Beltravers, "or, if I may
call you by that sweet name, Gwendolen, I have
brought you here for the purpose of making an offer
to you. Perhaps it would have been more in accordance
with etiquette had I approached your mother first."</p>

<p>"Mother is dead," said the girl simply.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Lord Beltravers, bending his
head in courtly sympathy. "In that case I should have
asked your father to hear my suit."</p>

<p>"Father is deaf," she replied. "He couldn't have
heard it."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," said Lord Beltravers impatiently. "I
beg your pardon," he added at once, "I should have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
controlled myself. That being so," he went on, "I
have the honour to make to you, Miss French, an offer
of marriage. May I hope?"</p>

<p>Gwendolen put her hand suddenly to her heart. The
shock was too much for her fresh young innocence. She
was not really engaged to Giles Earwaker, though he,
too, was hoping; and the only three times that Thomas
Ritson had kissed her she had threatened to box his
ears.</p>

<p>"Lord Beltravers," she began&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Call me Beltravers," he begged.</p>

<p>"Beltravers, I love you. I give you a simple maiden's
heart."</p>

<p>"My darling!" he cried, clasping her thumb impulsively.
"Then we are affianced."</p>

<p>He slipped a ring off his finger and fitted it affectionately
on two of hers.</p>

<p>"Wear this," he said gravely. "It was my mother's.
She was a de Dindigul. See, this is their crest&mdash;a roe-less
herring over the motto <i>Dans l'huile</i>." Observing
that she looked puzzled he translated the noble French
words to her. "And now let us go in. Another dance
is beginning. May I beg for the honour?"</p>

<p>"Beltravers," she whispered lovingly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<h4>CHAPTER IV</h4>

<h5>EXPOSURE</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next dance was at its height. In a dream of
happiness Gwendolen revolved with closed eyes round
Lord Beltravers, of Beltravers Castle, Beltravers.</p>

<p>Suddenly above the music rose a voice, commanding,
threatening.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried the Lady Beltravers.</p>

<p>As if by magic the band ceased and all the dancers
were still.</p>

<p>"There is an intruder here," said Lady Beltravers
in a cold voice. "A milkmaid, a common farmer's
daughter. Gwendolen French, leave my house this
instant!"</p>

<p>Dazed, hardly knowing what she did, Gwendolen
moved forward. In an instant Lord Beltravers was
after her.</p>

<p>"No, mother," he said, with the utmost dignity.
"Not a common milkmaid, but the future Lady
Beltravers."</p>

<p>An indescribable thrill of emotion ran through the
crowded ball-room. Lord Hobble's stud fell out; and
Lady Susan Golightly hurried across the room and
fainted in the arms of Sir James Batt.</p>

<p>"What!" cried the Lady Beltravers. "My son,
the last of the Beltraverses, the Beltraverses who came
over with Julius Wernher, I should say C&aelig;sar, marry
a milkmaid?"</p>

<p>"No, mother. He is marrying what any man would
be proud to marry&mdash;a simple English girl."</p>

<p>There was a cheer, instantly suppressed, from a
Socialist in the band.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>For just a moment words failed the Lady Beltravers.
Then she sank into a chair, and waved her guests away.</p>

<p>"The ball is over," she said slowly. "Leave me.
My son and I must be alone."</p>

<p>One by one, with murmured thanks for a delightful
evening, the guests trooped out. Soon mother and
son were alone. Lord Beltravers, gazing out of the
window, saw the 'cellist laboriously dragging his 'cello
across the park.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>
<h4>CHAPTER V</h4>

<h5>THE END</h5>

<p>[<span class="smcap">And</span> now, dear readers, I am in a difficulty. How
shall the story go on? The editor of <i>The Seaside
Library</i> asks quite frankly for a murder. His idea was
that the Lady Beltravers should be found dead in the
park next morning and that Gwendolen should be
arrested. This seems to me both crude and vulgar.
Besides, I want a murder for No. XCIX. of the series&mdash;<i>The
Severed Thumb</i>.</p>

<p>No, I think I know a better way out.]</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>Old John French sat beneath a spreading pear tree,
and waited. Early that morning a mysterious note
had been brought to him, asking for an interview on a
matter of the utmost importance. This was the
trysting-place.</p>

<p>"I have come," said a voice behind him, "to ask
you to beg your daughter&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I <span class="smcapl">HAVE COME</span>," cried the Lady Beltravers, "<span class="smcapl">TO
ASK YOU</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I HAVE COME," shouted her ladyship, "TO&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>John French wheeled round in amazement. With
a cry the Lady Beltravers shrank back.</p>

<p>"Eustace," she gasped&mdash;"Eustace, Earl of Turbot!"</p>

<p>"Eliza!"</p>

<p>"What are you doing here? I came to see John
French."</p>

<p>"What?" he asked, with his hand to his ear.</p>

<p>She repeated her remark loudly several times.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> John French," he said at last. "When you
refused me and married Beltravers I suddenly felt tired
of Society; and I changed my name and settled down
here as a simple farmer. My daughter helps me on the
farm."</p>

<p>"Then your daughter is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lady Gwendolen Hake."</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>A beautiful double wedding was solemnized at
Beltravers in October, the Earl of Turbot leading
Eliza, Lady Beltravers to the altar, while Lord Beltravers
was joined in matrimony to the beautiful
Lady Gwendolen Hake. There were many presents
on both sides, which partook equally of the beautiful
and the costly.</p>

<p>Lady Gwendolen Beltravers is now the most popular
hostess in the county; but to her husband she always
seems the simple English milkmaid that he first thought
her. Ah!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="THE_SECRET_OF_THE_ARMY" id="THE_SECRET_OF_THE_ARMY"></a>THE SECRET OF THE ARMY AEROPLANE</h3>

<p class="hd5">[In the thrilling manner of Mr. William le Queux.]</p>

<p class="cap">"<span class="dcap">Yes</span>," said my friend, Ray Raymond, as a
grim smile crossed his typically English face,
looking round the chambers which we shared
together, though he never had occasion to practise,
though I unfortunately had, "it is a very curious affair
indeed."</p>

<p>"Tell us the whole facts, Ray," urged Vera Vallance,
the pretty fair-haired daughter of Admiral Sir Charles
Vallance, to whom he was engaged.</p>

<p>"Well, dear, they are briefly as follows," he replied,
with an affectionate glance at her. "It is well known
that the Germans are anxious to get hold of our new
aeroplane, and that the secret of it is at present locked
in the inventor's breast. Last Tuesday a man with his
moustache brushed up the wrong way alighted at
Basingstoke station and enquired for the refreshment-room.
This leads me to believe that a dastardly attempt
is about to be made to wrest the supremacy of the air
from our grasp!" Immediately I swooned.</p>

<p>"And even in the face of this the Government
denies the activity of German spies in England!"
I exclaimed bitterly as soon as I had recovered consciousness.</p>

<p>"Jacox," said my old friend, "as a patriot it is
none the less my duty to expose these miscreants.
To-morrow we go to Basingstoke."</p>

<p>Next Thursday, then, saw us ensconced in our private
sitting-room at the Bull Hotel, Basingstoke. On our
way from the station I had noticed how ill-prepared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the town was to resist invasion, and I had pointed this
out bitterly to my dear old friend, Ray Raymond.</p>

<p>"Yes," he remarked, grimly; "and it is simply
infested with spies. Jack, my surmises are proving
correct. There will be dangerous work afoot to-night.
Have you brought your electric torch with you?"</p>

<p>"Since that Rosyth affair, I never travel without
it," I replied, as I stood with my back to the cheap
mantel-shelf so common in English hotels.</p>

<p>The night was dark, therefore we proceeded with
caution as we left the inn. The actions of Ray Raymond
were curious. As we passed each telegraph pole
he stopped and said grimly, "Ah, I thought so"; and
drew his revolver. When we had covered fifteen
miles we looked at our watches by the aid of our
electric torches and discovered that it was time to
get back to the hotel unless we wished our presence, or
rather absence, to be made known to the German spies;
therefore we returned hastily.</p>

<p>Next morning Ray was recalled to town by an urgent
telegram, therefore I was left alone at Basingstoke to
foil the dastardly spies. I stayed there for thirteen
weeks, and then went with my old friend to Grimsby,
he having received news that a German hairdresser,
named Macdonald, was resident in that town.</p>

<p>"My dear Jack," said my friend Ray Raymond, his
face assuming the sphinx-like expression by which I
knew that he had formed some theory for the destruction
of his country's dastardly enemies, "to-night we
shall come to grips with the Teuton!"</p>

<p>"And yet," I cried, "the Government refuses to
admit the activity of German spies in England!"</p>

<p>"Ha!" said my friend grimly.</p>

<p>He opened a small black bag and produced a dark
lantern, a coil of strong silk rope, and a small but
serviceable jemmy. All that burglarious outfit
belonged to my friend!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment the pretty fair girl to whom he
was engaged, Vera Vallance, arrived, but returned
to London by the next train.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock we proceeded cautiously to the house
of Macdonald the hairdresser, whom Ray had discovered
to be a German spy!</p>

<p>"Have you your electric torch with you?" inquired
my dear old college friend.</p>

<p>"I have," I answered grimly.</p>

<p>"Good! Then let us enter!"</p>

<p>"You mean to break in?" I cried, amazed at the
audacity of my friend.</p>

<p>"Bah!" he said. "Spies are always cowards!"</p>

<p>Therefore we knocked at the door. It was opened
by two men, the elder of whom gave vent to a quick
German imprecation. The younger had a short beard.</p>

<p>"You are a German spy?" enquired Ray Raymond.</p>

<p>"No," replied the bearded German in very good
English, adding with marvellous coolness: "To what,
pray, do we owe this unwarrantable intrusion?"</p>

<p>"To the fact that you are a spy who has been taking
secret tracings of our Army aeroplane!" retorted my
friend.</p>

<p>But the spy only laughed in open defiance.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no law against it," he replied.</p>

<p>"No," retorted Ray grimly, "thanks to the stupidity
of a crass Government, there <i>is</i> no law against it."</p>

<p>"My God!" I said hoarsely, and my face went the
colour of ashes.</p>

<p>"But my old friend Jacass&mdash;I mean Jacox&mdash;and
I," continued Ray Raymond, fixing the miserable spy
with his eye, "have decided to take the law into our
own hands. I have my revolver and my friend has
his electric torch. Give me the tracings."</p>

<p>"Gott&mdash;no!" cried the German spies in German.
"Never, you English cur!"</p>

<p>But Ray had already extracted a letter from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
elder man's pocket, and was making for the door!
I followed him. When we got back to our hotel he
drew the letter from his pocket and eagerly examined
it. I give here an exact copy of it, and I may state
that when we sent it to His Majesty's Minister for War
he returned it without a word!</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="rgt">"<span class="rsmcap">Berkeley Chambers,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Cannon Street, E.C.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;In reply to yours of the 29th ult. we beg

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. James Macdonald</span>."</p>
</div></div>

<p>That letter, innocent enough upon the face of it,
contained dastardly instructions from the Chief of
Police to a German spy! Read by the alphabetical
code supplied to every German secret agent in England,
it ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Phrase 1</i>). "Discover without delay secret of new

<p>(<i>Phrase 2</i>). "Forward particulars of best plan for

a revolver and an electric torch."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" said my friend grimly, "we were only just
in time. Had we delayed longer, England might have
knelt at the proud foot of a conqueror!"</p>

<p>"Ha!" I replied briefly.</p>

<p>Next morning we returned to the chambers which
we shared together in London, and were joined by
Vera Vallance, the pretty fair daughter of Admiral
Sir Charles Vallance, to whom my old friend was engaged.
And, as he stroked her hair affectionately, I
realised thankfully that he and I had indeed been the
instruments of Providence in foiling the plots of the
German spies!</p>

<h4>CHAPTER I</h4>

<h5>SUNDAY MORNING</h5>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Mrs. Barclay</span> <i>begins</i>)</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> was a beautiful Sunday morning. All nature
browsed in solemn Sabbath stillness. The Little
Grey Woman of the Night-Light was hurrying,
somewhat late, to church.</p>

<p>Down the white ribbon of road the Virile Benedict
of the Libraries came bicycling, treadling easily from
the ankles. He rode boldly, with only one hand on
the handle-bars, the other in the pocket of his white
flannel cricketing trousers. His footballing tie, with
his college arms embroidered upon it, flapped gently
in the breeze. To look at him you would have said
that he was probably a crack polo player on his way to
defend the championship against all comers, or the
captain of a county golf eleven. As he rode, his soul
overflowing with the joy of life, he hummed the Collect
for the Day.</p>

<p>It was exactly opposite the church that he ran into
the Little Grey Woman of the Night-Light. He had
just flashed past a labourer in the road&mdash;known to his
cronies as the Flap-eared Denizen of the Turnip-patch&mdash;a
labourer who in the dear dead days of Queen
Victoria would have touched his hat humbly, but who
now, in this horrible age of attempts to level all class<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
distinctions, actually went on lighting his pipe! Alas,
that the respectful deference of the poor toward the
rich is now a thing of the past! So thought the Virile
Benedict of the Libraries, and in thinking this he had
let his mind wander from the important business of
guiding his bicycle! In another moment he had run
into the Little Grey Woman of the Night-Light!</p>

<p>She had seen him coming and had given a warning
cry, but it was too late. The next moment he shot
over his handle-bars; but even as he revolved through
the air he wondered how old she really was, and what,
if any, was her income. For since the death of the
Little White Lady he had formed a habit of marrying
elderly women for their money, and his fifth or sixth
wife had perished of old age only a few months ago.</p>

<p>[<i>Hall Caine</i> (waking up). <i>Who, pray, is the Little
White Lady?</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Barclay. His first wife. She comes in my book,
"The Broken Halo," now in its two hundredth edition.</i></p>

<p><i>Hall Caine</i> (annoyed). <i>Tut!</i>]</p>

<p>"Jove," he said cheerily, as he picked himself and
her and his bicycle up, "that was a nasty spill. As
my Aunt Louisa used to say to the curate when he
upset the milk-jug into her lap, 'No milk, thank you.'"
His brown eyes danced with amusement as he related
this reminiscence of his boyhood. To the Little Grey
Woman he seemed to exhale youth from every pore.</p>

<p>"What did your Aunt Louisa say when her ankle
was sprained?" she asked with a rueful smile.</p>

<p>In an instant the merry banter faded from the Virile
Benedict's brown eyes, and was replaced by the commanding
look of one who has taken a brilliant degree
in all his medical examinations.</p>

<p>"Allow me," he said brusquely; "I am a doctor."
He bent down and listened to her ankle.</p>

<p>It did not take Dr. Dick Cameron's quick ear long
to find out all there was to know. His manner became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
very gentle and his voice very low; and, though he
continued to exhale youth, he did it less ostentatiously
than before.</p>

<p>"I must carry you home," he said, picking her up
in his strong young arms; "you cannot go to church
to-day."</p>

<p>"But the curate is preaching!"</p>

<p>Dr. Dick murmured something profane under his
breath about curates. He had, alas! these moments
of irreverence; as, for instance, on one occasion when
he had spoken of Mr. Louis N. Parker's noble picture-play,
"Joseph and his Brethren," quite shortly as
"Jos. Bros."</p>

<p>"I will carry you home," he said gently. "Tell me
where you live, Little Grey Woman."</p>

<p>She smiled up at him bravely. "The Manor House,"
she said.</p>

<p>His voice became yet more gentle. "And now tell
me your income," he whispered; and his whole being
trembled with emotion as he waited for her reply.</p>

<p>[<i>Mrs. Barclay. There! That's the end of the chapter.
Now it's your turn.</i></p>

<p><i>Hall Caine</i> (waking up). <i>I don't know if I told you
that in my last great work of the imagination, in which
I collaborated with the Bishop of London, I wrote
throughout in the first person. Nearly a million copies
were sold, thus showing that the heart of the great
public approved of my method of telling my story
through the mouth of a young and innocent girl,
exposed to great temptation. I should wish, therefore,
to repeat that method in this story, if you could so
arrange it.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Barclay. But that's easy. The Little Grey
Woman shall tell Dr. Dick the story of her first marriage.
I did that in my last book, "The Broken Halo," now in
its two hundredth edition.</i></p>

<p><i>Hall Caine</i> (annoyed). <i>Tut!</i>]</p>

<h4>CHAPTER II</h4>

<h5>UNDER THE CEDAR</h5>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Mrs. Barclay</span> <i>continues</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> were having tea in the garden&mdash;the Little Grey
Woman and Dr. Dick. More than six months had
elapsed since the accident outside the church, and
Dr. Dick still remained on at the Manor House in
charge of his patient, wishing to be handy in case the
old sprain came on again suddenly. She was eighty-two
and had twelve thousand a year. On the lawn a
thrush was singing.</p>

<p>"How fresh and green the world is to-day," sighed
Dr. Dick, leaning back and exhaling youth. "As the
curate used to say to my Aunt Louisa, 'A delightful
shower after the rain.'" He laughed merrily, and
threw a crumb at the thrush with the perfect aim of
a good cricketer throwing the ball at the wickets.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," said the Little Grey Woman, "the
world is always fresh and green to youth like yours.
But to an old woman like me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not old," said Dick, with an ardent glance; "only
eighty-two. Mrs. Beauchamp, will you marry me?"</p>

<p>She looked at him with a sad but tender smile.</p>

<p>"What <i>would</i> my friends say?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Bother your friends."</p>

<p>"My dear boy, you would be considerably surprised
if you could glance through an approximate list of the
friends I possess to-day. Do you know that if I marry
you I shall be required to make an explanation to
several royal ladies&mdash;that is, if they graciously grant
me the opportunity so to do."</p>

<p>"But I want your mon&mdash;I mean I <i>love</i> you," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
pleaded, the light of youth shining in his brown
eyes.</p>

<p>The Little Grey Woman looked at him tenderly.
Their eyes met.</p>

<p>"Listen," she said. "I will tell you the story of
my first marriage, and then if you wish you shall ask
me again."</p>

<p>Dr. Dick helped himself to another slice of cake and
leant back to listen.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III</h4>

<h5>MRS. BEAUCHAMP'S STORY</h5>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Mr. Hall Caine</span> <i>takes up the tale</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> always had a wonderful memory, and my
earliest recollection is of hearing my father ask, on the
day when I was born, whether it was a boy or a girl.
When they told him "a girl," he let fall a rough expression
which sent the blood coursing over my mother's
pale cheeks like lobster-sauce coursing over a turbot.
My father, John Boomster, was a great advertising
agent, perhaps the greatest in the island, though he
always said that there was one man who could beat
him. He wanted a son to succeed him in the business,
and in the years to come he never forgave me for being
a girl. He would often glare at me in silence for three-quarters
of an hour, and then, letting fall the same
rough expression, throw a boot at me and stride from
the room. A hard, cruel man, my father, and yet, in
his fashion, he was fond of me.</p>

<p>It was not until I was eighteen that he first spoke to
me. To my dying day I shall never forget that evening;
nor his words, which bit themselves into my mind
as a red-hot iron bites its way into cheese.</p>

<p>"Nell," he said, for that was my name, though he
had never used it before, "I've arranged that you are
to marry Lord Wurzel two months from to-day."</p>

<p>At these terrible words the blood ebbed slowly from
my ears and my hands grew hot.</p>

<p>"I do not know him," I said in a stifled voice.</p>

<p>"You will to-morrow," he laughed brutally, and
with another rough word he strode from the room.</p>

<p>Lord Wurzel! I ran upstairs to my room and flung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
myself face downwards on the bed. In my agony I
bit a large piece out of my pillow. The blood flowed
forward and backward over me in waves, and I burst
every now and then into a passion of weeping.</p>

<p>By and by I began to feel more serene. I decided
that it was my duty to obey my father. My heart leapt
within me at the thought of doing my duty, and to
calm myself I put on my hat and wandered into the
glen. It was very silent in the glen. There was no
sound but the rustling of the leaves overhead, the
popping of the insects underfoot, the sneezing of the
cattle, the whistling of the pigs, the coughing of the
field-mice, the roaring of the rabbits, and the deep
organ-song of the sea.</p>

<p>But suddenly, above all these noises, I heard a voice
which sent the blood ebbing and flowing in my heart and
caused the back of my neck to quiver with ecstasy.</p>

<p>"Nell!" it said.</p>

<p>It was the voice of my old comrade, Andrew Spinnaker,
who had played with me in our childhood's days,
and whom I had not seen now for eight years.</p>

<p>"Andrew!" I cried, as I turned round. "What are
you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I am just off to discover the South Pole," he said.
"My shipmates are waiting for me to command the
expedition."</p>

<p>I noticed then for the first time that he was dressed
in a seal-skin cap and a pair of sleeping-bags.</p>

<p>"Nell," he went on, "before I go, tell me you love
me."</p>

<p>My heart fluttered like a captured bird; my knees
trembled like a drunken spider's; my throat was stifled
like a stifled throat. A huge wave of something or
other surged over me and told me that the great mystery
of the world had happened to me.</p>

<p>I was in love.</p>

<p>I was in love with Andrew Spinnaker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Andrew," I cried, falling on his startled chin, "I
love you." All the back of my neck thrilled with joy.</p>

<p>But my joy was shortlived. No sooner had I become
aware that I loved Andrew Spinnaker than my conscience
told me I had no right to do so. I was going to
marry Lord Wurzel, and to love another than my
husband was sin. I shook Andrew off my lips.</p>

<p>"I love you," I said, "but I cannot marry you. I
am marrying Lord Wurzel."</p>

<p>"That beast?" cried Andrew, in the impetuous
sailor fashion which so endeared him to his shipmates.
"When I come back I will thrash him as I would thrash
a vicious ape."</p>

<p>"When will that be?"</p>

<p>"In about two months," said my darling boy.
"This is going to be a very quick expedition."</p>

<p>"Alas, that will be my wedding day," I said with
a low sob like that of a buffalo yearning for its mate.
"It will be too late."</p>

<p>Andrew took me in his strong arms. I should not
have let him, but I could not help it.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said, "I will start back from the Pole
a day before my shipmates, and save you from that
d-sh-d beast. And then I will marry you, Nell."</p>

<p>There was a roaring in my ears like the roaring of
the bath when the tap is left on; many waters seemed
to rush upon me; my hat fell off, and then deep
oblivion came over me and I swooned.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>To go through my emotions in detail during the next
two months would be but to harrow you needlessly.
Suffice it to say that seventeen times I flung myself
face downwards on my bed and bit a piece out of the
pillow, on twenty-nine occasions the blood ebbed
slowly from my face, and my heart fluttered like a
captured bird, while in a hundred and forty instances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
a wave of emotion surged slowly over my whole body,
leaving me trembling like an aspen leaf. Otherwise
my health remained good.</p>

<p>It was the night before the wedding. The bad Lord
Wurzel had just left me with words of love upon his
lying lips. To-morrow, unless Andrew Spinnaker
saved me, I should be Lady Wurzel.</p>

<p>"A marconigram for you, miss," said our faithful
old gardener, William, entering the drawing-room
noiselessly by the chimney. "I brought it myself to
be sure you got it."</p>

<p>With trembling fingers I tore it open. How my
heart leapt and the hot colour flooded my neck and
brow when I recognised the dear schoolboy writing of
my beloved Andrew! I have the message still. It
went like this:</p>

<div class="lett"><div class="blockquot"><p class="rgt">"<i>Wireless&mdash;South Pole.</i></p>

<p>Arrived safe. Found Pole. Weather charming.
Blue sky. Not a breath of wind. Am wearing my
thick socks. Sun never going down. Constellations
revolving without dipping. Moon going sideways.
Am starting for England to-morrow. Arrive Victoria
twelve o'clock, Wednesday.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Andrew</span>."</p></div></div>

<p>Back on Wednesday! And to-morrow was Tuesday&mdash;my
wedding day! There was no hope. I felt like a
shipwrecked voyager. For the thirty-fifth time since
the beginning of the month deep oblivion came over
me, and I swooned.</p>

<p>[<i>Hall Caine. I think you might go on now. I have
put a little life into the story. It is, perhaps, not quite
so vivid as my last work, "The Woman Thou Gavest

<h4>THE MYSTERY OF GORDON SQUARE</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">Synopsis of Previous Chapters</span></h5>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Roger Dangerfield</span>, the famous barrister,
is passing through Gordon Square one December
night when he suddenly comes across the
dead body of a man of about forty years. To his horror
he recognises it to be that of his friend, Sir Eustace
Butt, M.P., who has been stabbed in seven places.
Much perturbed by the incident, Roger goes home and
decides to lead a new life. Hitherto he had been
notorious in the London clubs for his luxurious habits,
but now he rises at 7.30 every morning and breathes
evenly through the nose for five minutes before dressing.</p>

<p>After three weeks of the breathing exercise, Roger
adds a few simple lunges to his morning drill. Detective-Inspector
Frenchard tells him that he has a clue
to the death of Sir Eustace, but that the murderer is
still at large. Roger sells his London house and takes
a cottage in the country, where he practises the simple
life. He is now lunging ten times to the right, ten
times to the left and ten times backwards every morning,
besides breathing lightly through the nose during
his bath.</p>

<p>One day he meets a Yogi, who tells him that if he
desires to track the murderer down he must learn concentration.
He suggests that Roger should start by
concentrating on the word "wardrobe," and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
leaves this story and goes back to India. Roger sells
his house in the country and comes back to town,
where he concentrates for half an hour daily on the
word "wardrobe," besides, of course, persevering
with his breathing and lunging exercises. After a
heavy morning's drill he is passing through Gordon
Square when he comes across the body of his old
friend, Sir Joshua Tubbs, M.P., who has been stabbed
nine times. Roger returns home quickly, and decides
to practise breathing through the ears.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>
<h4>CHAPTER XCI</h4>

<h5>PREPARATION</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> appalling death of Sir Joshua Tubbs, M.P., following
so closely upon that of Sir Eustace Butt, M.P.,
meant the beginning of a new life for Roger. His
morning drill now took the following form:&mdash;</p>

<p>On rising at 7.30 a.m. he sipped a glass of distilled
water, at the same time concentrating on the word
"wardrobe." This lasted for ten minutes, after which
he stood before the open window for five minutes,
breathing alternately through the right ear and the
left. A vigorous series of lunges followed, together
with the simple kicking exercises detailed in chapter <span class="smcapl">LIV</span>.</p>

<p>These over, there was a brief interval of rest, during
which our hero, breathing heavily through the back
of the head, concentrated on the word "dough-nut."
Refreshed by the mental discipline, he rose and stood
lightly on the ball of his left foot, at the same time
massaging himself vigorously between the shoulders
with his right. After five minutes of this he would
rest again, lying motionless except for a circular movement
of the ears. A cold bath, a brisk rub down and
another glass of distilled water completed the morning
training.</p>

<p>But it is time we got on with the story. The murder
of Sir Joshua Tubbs, M.P. had sent a thrill of horror
through England, and hundreds of people wrote indignant
letters to the Press, blaming the police for their
neglect to discover the assassin. Detective-Inspector
Frenchard, however, was hard at work, and he was
inspired by the knowledge that he could always rely
upon the assistance of Roger Dangerfield, the famous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
barrister, who had sworn to track the murderer down.</p>

<p>To prepare himself for the forthcoming struggle
Roger decided, one sunny day in June, to give up the
meat diet upon which he had relied so long, and to
devote himself entirely to a vegetable <i>r&eacute;gime</i>. With
that thoroughness which was now becoming a characteristic
of him, he left London and returned to the
country, with the intention of making a study of food
values.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>
<h4>CHAPTER XCII</h4>

<h5>LOVE COMES IN</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a beautiful day in July and the country was
looking its best. Roger rose at 7.30 a.m. and performed
those gentle, health-giving exercises which have already
been described in previous chapters. On this glorious
morning, however, he added a simple exercise for the
elbows to his customary ones, and went down to his
breakfast as hungry as the proverbial hunter. A substantial
meal of five dried beans and a stewed nut
awaited him in the fine oak-panelled library; and as
he did ample justice to the banquet his thoughts went
back to the terrible days when he lived the luxurious
meat-eating life of the ordinary man-about-town; to
the evening when he discovered the body of Sir Eustace
Butt, M.P., and swore to bring the assassin to vengeance;
to the day when&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly he realised that his thoughts were wandering.
With iron will he controlled them and concentrated
fixedly on the word "dough-nut" for twelve
minutes. Greatly refreshed, he rose and strode out
into the sun.</p>

<p>At the door of his cottage a girl was standing. She
was extremely beautiful, and Roger's heart would have
jumped if he had not had that organ (thanks to
Twisting Exercise 23) under perfect control.</p>

<p>"Is this the way to Denfield?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Straight on," said Roger.</p>

<p>He returned to his cottage, breathing heavily
through his ears.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>
<h4>CHAPTER XCIII</h4>

<h5>ANOTHER SURPRISE</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Six</span> months went by, and the murderer of Sir Joshua
Tubbs, M.P. and Sir Eustace Butt, M.P. still remained
at large. Roger had sold his cottage in the country
and was now in London, performing his exercises with
regularity, concentrating daily upon the words "wardrobe,"
"dough-nut," and "wasp," and living entirely
upon proteids.</p>

<p>One day he had the idea that he would start a
restaurant in the East-End for the sale of meatless
foods. This would bring him in touch with the lower
classes, among whom he expected to find the assassin
of his two oldest friends.</p>

<p>In less than three or four years the shop was a tremendous
success. In spite of this, however, Roger did not
neglect his exercises; taking particular care to keep
the toes well turned in when lunging ten times backwards.
(Exercise 17.) Once, to his joy, the girl whom
he had first met outside his country cottage came in
and had her simple lunch of Smilopat (ninepence the
dab) at his shop. That evening he lunged twelve times
to the right instead of ten.</p>

<p>One day business had taken Roger to the West-End.
As he was returning home at midnight through
Gordon Square, he suddenly stopped and staggered
back.</p>

<p>A body lay on the ground before him!</p>

<p>Hastily turning it over upon its face, Roger gave a
cry of horror.</p>

<p>It was Detective-Inspector Frenchard! Stabbed in
eleven places!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Roger hurried madly home, and devised an entirely
new set of exercises for his morning drill. A full
description of these, however, must be reserved for
another chapter.</p>

<h3><a name="ON_THE_BATS_BACK" id="ON_THE_BATS_BACK"></a>ON THE BAT'S BACK</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">With</span> the idea of brightening cricket, my
friend Twyford has given me a new bat. I
have always felt that, in my own case, it
was the inadequacy of the weapon rather than of the
man behind it which accounted for a certain monotony
of low-scoring; with this new bat I hope to prove the
correctness of my theory.</p>

<p>My old bat has always been a trier, but of late it
has been manifestly past its work. Again and again
its drive over long-off's head has failed to carry the
bunker at mid-off. More than once it has proved itself
an inch too narrow to ensure that cut-past-third-man-to-the-boundary
which is considered one of the most
graceful strokes in my repertoire. Worst of all, I have
found it at moments of crisis (such as the beginning
of the first over) utterly inadequate to deal with the
ball which keeps low. When bowled by such a ball&mdash;and
I may say that I am never bowled by any other&mdash;I
look reproachfully at the bottom of my bat as I walk
back to the pavilion. "Surely," I say to it, "you were
much longer than this when we started out?"</p>

<p>Perhaps it was not magnanimous always to put the
blame on my partner for our accidents together. It
would have been more chivalrous to have shielded him.
"No, no," I should have said to my companions as
they received me with sympathetic murmurs of "Bad
luck,"&mdash;"no, no, you mustn't think that. It was my
own fault. Don't reproach the bat." It would have
been well to have spoken thus; and indeed, when I
had had time to collect myself, I did so speak. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
out on the field, in the first shame of defeat, I had to let
the truth come out. That one reproachful glance at
my bat I could not hide.</p>

<p>But there was one habit of my bat's&mdash;a weakness of
old age, I admit, but not the less annoying&mdash;about
which it was my duty to let all the world know. One's
grandfather may have a passion for the gum on the
back of postage-stamps, and one hushes it up; but if
he be deaf the visitor must be warned. My bat had a
certain looseness in the shoulder, so that, at any quick
movement of it, it clicked. If I struck the ball well
and truly in the direction of point this defect did not
matter; but if the ball went past me into the hands of
the wicket-keeper, an unobservant bowler would
frequently say, "How's that?" And an ill-informed
umpire would reply, "Out." It was my duty before
the game began to take the visiting umpire on one
side and give him a practical demonstration of the
click ...</p>

<p>But these are troubles of the past. I have my new
bat now, and I can see that cricket will become a
different game for me. My practice of this morning
has convinced me of this. It was not one of your
stupid practices at the net, with two burly professionals
bumping down balls at your body and telling you to
"Come out to them, Sir." It was a quiet practice in my
rooms after breakfast, with no moving object to distract
my attention and spoil my stroke. The bat comes
up well. It is light, and yet there is plenty of wood in
it. Its drives along the carpet were excellent; its cuts
and leg glides all that could be wished. I was a little
disappointed with its half-arm hook, which dislodged a
teacup and gave what would have been an easy catch
to mid-on standing close in by the sofa; but I am convinced
that a little oil will soon put that right.</p>

<p>And yet there seemed to be something lacking in it.
After trying every stroke with it; after tucking it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
under my arm and walking back to the bathroom,
touching my cap at the pianola on the way; after
experiments with it in all positions, I still felt that there
was something wanting to make it the perfect bat.
So I put it in a cab and went round with it to Henry.
Henry has brightened first-class cricket for some years
now.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Henry," I said, "what's wrong with this
bat?"</p>

<p>"It seems all right," he said, after waving it about.
"Rather a good one."</p>

<p>I laid it down on the floor and looked at it. Then I
turned it on its face and looked at it. And then I
knew.</p>

<p>"It wants a little silver shield on the back," I said.
"That's it."</p>

<p>"Why, is it a presentation bat?" asked Henry.</p>

<p>"In a sense, yes. It was presented to me by Twyford."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Really," I said modestly, "I hardly like&mdash;&mdash; Why
do people give one things? Affection, Henry; pity,
generosity&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you going to put that on the shield? 'Presented
out of sheer pity to&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly; of course not. I shall put 'Presented
in commemoration of his masterly double
century against the Authentics,' or something like that.
You've no idea how it impresses the wicket-keeper.
He really sees quite a lot of the back of one's bat."</p>

<p>"Your inscription," said Henry, as he filled his pipe
slowly, "will be either a lie or extremely unimpressive."</p>

<p>"It will be neither, Henry. If I put my own name
on it, and talked about <i>my</i> double century, of course it
would be a lie; but the inscription will be to Stanley
Bolland."</p>

<p>"Who's he?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know. I've just made him up. But now,
supposing my little shield says, 'Stanley Bolland.
H.P.C.C.&mdash;Season 1912. Batting average 116.34.'&mdash;how
is that a lie?"</p>

<p>"What does H.P.C.C. stand for?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It doesn't mean anything really.
I'll leave out 'Batting average' if it makes it more
truthful. 'Stanley Bolland. H.P.C.C., 1912. 116.34.'
It's really just a little note I make on the back of my
bat to remind me of something or other I've forgotten.
116.34 is probably Bolland's telephone number or the
size of something I want at his shop. But by a pure
accident the wicket-keeper thinks it means something
else; and he tells the bowler at the end of the over that
it's that chap Bolland who had an average of over a
century for the Hampstead Polytechnic last year. Of
course that makes the bowler nervous and he starts
sending down long-hops."</p>

<p>"I see," said Henry; and he began to read his paper
again.</p>

<p>So to-morrow I take my bat to the silversmith's
and have a little engraved shield fastened on. Of
course, with a really trustworthy weapon I am certain
to collect pots of runs this season. But there is no harm
in making things as easy as possible for oneself.</p>

<p>And yet there is this to be thought of. Even the
very best bat in the world may fail to score, and it
might so happen that I was dismissed (owing to some
defect in the pitch) before my silver shield had time to
impress the opposition. Or again, I might (through
ill-health) perform so badly that quite a wrong impression
of the standard of the Hampstead Polytechnic
would be created, an impression which I should hate
to be the innocent means of circulating.</p>

<p>So on second thoughts I lean to a different inscription.
On the back of my bat a plain silver shield will
say quite simply this:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="hd6">To<br />
Stanley Bolland,<br />
for saving life at sea.<br />
From a few Admirers.</p>

<p>Thus I shall have two strings to my bow. And if, by
any unhappy chance, I fail as a cricketer, the wicket-keeper
will say to his comrades as I walk sadly to the
pavilion, "A poor bat perhaps, but a brave&mdash;a very
brave fellow."</p>

<p>It becomes us all to make at least one effort to
brighten cricket.</p>

<p>"Monday," I said, "Monday. No, don't tell
me&mdash;I shall get it in a moment. Monday ... He's
the one who&mdash;&mdash; Oh, you mean the day of the
week?"</p>

<p>"Who's a funny?" asked Celia of the teapot.</p>

<p>"Sorry; I really thought you meant another relation.
What am I doing? I'm playing golf if I can find somebody
to play with."</p>

<p>"Well, ask Edward."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>I could place Edward at once. Edward, I need
hardly say, is Celia's uncle; one of the ones I have not
yet met. He married a very young aunt of hers, not
much older than Celia.</p>

<p>"But I don't know him," I said.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter. Write and ask him to meet you
at the golf club. I'm sure he'd love to."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't he think it rather cool, this sudden attack
from a perfectly unknown nephew? I fancy the first
step ought to come from uncle."</p>

<p>"But you're older than he is."</p>

<p>"True. It's rather a tricky point in etiquette. Well,
I'll risk it."</p>

<p>This was the letter I sent to him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Uncle Edward</span>,&mdash;Why haven't you
written to me this term? I have spent the five shillings
you gave me when I came back; it was awfully ripping
of you to give it to me, but I have spent it now. Are
you coming down to see me this term? If you aren't
you might write to me; there is a post-office here where
you can change postal orders.</p>

<p>"What I really meant to say was, can you play golf
with me on Monday at Mudbury Hill? I am your
new and favourite nephew, and it is quite time we met.
Be at the club-house at 2.30, if you can. I don't quite
know how we shall recognize each other, but the
well-dressed man in the nut-brown suit will probably
be me. My features are plain but good, except where
I fell against the bath-taps yesterday. If you have
fallen against anything which would give me a clue
to your face you might let me know. Also you might
let me know if you are a professor at golf; if you are,
I will read some more books on the subject between
now and Monday. Just at the moment my game is
putrid.</p>

<p>"Your niece and my wife sends her love. Good-bye.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
I was top of my class in Latin last week. I must now
stop, as it is my bath-night.</p>

<div class="lett"><p class="signing">"I am,<br />
"Your loving</p>
<p class="rgt">"<span class="smcap">Nephew</span>."</p></div></div>

<p>The next day I had a letter from my uncle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Nephew</span>,&mdash;I was so glad to get your nice
little letter and to hear that you were working hard.
Let me know when it is your bath-night again; these
things always interest me. I shall be delighted to play
golf with you on Monday. You will have no difficulty
in recognizing me. I should describe myself roughly
as something like Apollo and something like Little
Tich, if you know what I mean. It depends how you
come up to me. I am an excellent golfer and never
take more than two putts in a bunker.</p>

<p>"Till 2.30 then. I enclose a postal-order for sixpence,
to see you through the rest of the term.</p>

<div class="lett"><p class="signing">"Your favourite uncle,</p>
<p class="rgt">"<span class="smcap">Edward</span>."</p></div></div>

<p>I showed it to Celia.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you could describe him more minutely,"
I said. "I hate wandering about vaguely and
asking everybody I see if he's my uncle. It seems
so odd."</p>

<p>"You're sure to meet all right," said Celia confidently.
"He's&mdash;well, he's nice-looking and&mdash;and
clean-shaven&mdash;and, oh, <i>you'll</i> recognize him."</p>

<p>At 2.30 on Monday I arrived at the club-house and
waited for my uncle. Various people appeared, but none
seemed in want of a nephew. When 2.45 came there
was still no available uncle. True, there was one unattached
man reading in a corner of the smoke-room,
but he had a moustache&mdash;the sort of heavy moustache
one associates with a major.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>At three o'clock I became desperate. After all,
Celia had not seen Edward for some time. Perhaps
he had grown a moustache lately; perhaps he had
grown one specially for to-day. At any rate there would
be no harm in asking this major man if he was my
uncle. Even if he wasn't he might give me a game of
golf.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," I said politely, "but are you by any
chance my Uncle Edward?"</p>

<p>"Your <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"I was almost certain you weren't, but I thought I'd
just ask. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Not at all. Naturally one wants to find one's
uncle. Have you&mdash;er&mdash;lost him long?"</p>

<p>"Years," I said sadly. "Er&mdash;I wonder if you would
care to adopt me&mdash;I mean, give me a game this afternoon.
My man hasn't turned up."</p>

<p>"By all means. I'm not very great."</p>

<p>"Neither am I. Shall we start now? Good."</p>

<p>I was sorry to miss Edward, but I wasn't going to
miss a game of golf on such a lovely day. My spirits
rose. Not even the fact that there were no caddies
left and I had to carry my own clubs could depress
me.</p>

<p>The Major drove. I am not going to describe the
whole game; though my cleek shot at the fifth hole,
from a hanging lie to within two feet of the&mdash;&mdash; However,
I mustn't go into that now. But it surprised the
Major a good deal. And when at the next hole I laid
my brassie absolutely dead, he&mdash;&mdash; But I can tell
you about that some other time. It is sufficient to say
now that, when we reached the seventeenth tee, I was
one up.</p>

<p>We both played the seventeenth well. He was a foot
from the hole in four. I played my third from the edge
of the green, and was ridiculously short, giving myself
a twenty-foot putt for the hole. Leaving my clubs I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
went forward with the putter, and by the absurdest
luck pushed the ball in.</p>

<p>"Good," said the Major. "Your game."</p>

<p>I went back for my clubs. When I turned round
the Major was walking carelessly off to the next tee,
leaving the flag lying on the green and my ball still in
the tin.</p>

<p>"Slacker," I said to myself, and walked up to the
hole.</p>

<p>And then I had a terrible shock. I saw in the tin,
not my ball, but a moustache!</p>

<p>"Am I going mad?" I said. "I could have sworn
that I drove off with a 'Colonel,' and yet I seem to have
holed out with a Major's moustache!" I picked it up
and hurried after him.</p>

<p>"Major," I said, "excuse me, you've dropped your
moustache. It fell off at the critical stage of the match;
the shock of losing was too much for you; the strain
of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned his clean-shaven face round and grinned
at me.</p>

<p>"On second thoughts," he said, "I <i>am</i> your long-lost
uncle."</p>

<h3><a name="THE_RENASCENCE_OF_BRITAIN" id="THE_RENASCENCE_OF_BRITAIN"></a>THE RENASCENCE OF BRITAIN</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Peter Riley</span> was one of those lucky people
who take naturally to games. Actually he got
his blue for cricket, rugger, and boxing, but
his perfect eye and wrist made him a beautiful player of
any game with a ball. Also he rode and shot well, and
knew all about the inside of a car. But, although he
was always enthusiastic about anything he was doing,
he was not really keen on games. He preferred wandering
about the country looking for birds' nests or
discovering the haunts of rare butterflies; he liked
managing a small boat single-handed in a stiff breeze;
he would have enjoyed being upset and having to swim
a long way to shore. Most of all, perhaps, he loved to
lie on the top of the cliffs and think of the wonderful
things that he would do for England when he was a
Cabinet Minister. For politics was to be his profession,
and he had just taken a first in History by way of
preparation for it.</p>

<p>There were a lot of silly people who envied Peter's
mother. They thought, poor dears, that she must
be very, very proud of him, for they regarded Peter
as the ideal of the modern young Englishman. "If
only my boy grows up to be like Peter Riley!" they
used to say to themselves; and then add quickly,
"But of course he'll be much nicer." In their ignorance
they didn't see that it was the Peters of England who
were making our country the laughing-stock of the
world.</p>

<p>If you had been in Berlin in 1916, you would have
seen Peter; for he had been persuaded, much against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
his will, to uphold the honour of Great Britain in the
middle-weights at the Olympic Games. He got a position
in the papers as "P. Riley, disqualified"&mdash;the
result, he could only suppose, of his folly in allowing his
opponent to butt him in the stomach. He was both
annoyed and amused about it; offered to fight his
vanquisher any time in England; and privately
thanked Heaven that he could now get back to London
in time for his favourite sister's wedding.</p>

<p>But he didn't. The English trainer, who had been
sent, at the public expense, to America for a year, to
study the proper methods, got hold of him.</p>

<p>"I've been watching you, young man," he said.
"You'll have to give yourself up to me now. You're
the coming champion."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Peter politely, "but I shan't be
fighting again."</p>

<p>"Fighting!" said the trainer scornfully. "Don't
you worry; I'll take good care that you don't fight
any more. The event <i>you're</i> going to win is 'Pushing
the Chisel.' I've been watching you, and you've got
the most perfect neck and calf-muscles for it I've ever
seen. No more fighting for you, my boy; nor cricket,
nor anything else. I'm not going to let you spoil those
muscles."</p>

<p>"I don't think I've ever pushed the Chisel," said
Peter. "Besides, it's over, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Over? Of course it's over, and that confounded
American won. 'Poor old England,' as all the papers
said."</p>

<p>"Then it's too late to begin to practise," said Peter
thankfully.</p>

<p>"Well, it's too late for the 1920 games. But we can
do a lot in eight years, and I think I can get you fit for
the 1924 games at Pekin."</p>

<p>Peter stared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"My good man," he said at last, "in 1924 I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
shall be in London; and I hope in the House of
Commons."</p>

<p>"And what about the honour of your country?
Do you want to read the jeers in the American papers
when we lose 'Pushing the Chisel' in 1924?"</p>

<p>"I don't care a curse what the American papers
say," said Peter angrily.</p>

<p>"Then you're very different from other Englishmen,"
said the trainer sternly.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>Of course, Peter was persuaded; he couldn't let
England be the laughing-stock of the world. So for
eight years he lived under the eye of the trainer, rising
at five and retiring to bed at seven-thirty. This prevented
him from taking much part in the ordinary social
activities of the evening; and even his luncheon and
garden-party invitations had to be declined in some
such words as "Mr. Peter Riley regrets that he is unable
to accept Lady Vavasour's kind invitation for Monday
the 13th, as he will be hopping round the garden on one
leg then." His career, too, had to be abandoned;
for it was plain that, even if he had the leisure to get
into Parliament, the early hours he kept would not
allow him to take part in any important divisions.</p>

<p>But there were compensations. As he watched his
calves swell; as he looked in the glass and noticed
each morning that his head was a little more on one
side&mdash;sure sign of the expert Chisel-pusher; as, still
surer sign, his hands became more knuckly and his
mouth remained more permanently open, he knew
that his devotion to duty would not be without its
reward. He saw already his country triumphing, and
heard the chorus of congratulation in the newspapers
that England was still a nation of sportsmen....</p>

<p>In 1924 Pekin was crowded. There were, of course,
the ordinary million inhabitants; and, in addition,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
people had thronged from all parts to see the great
Chisel-pusher of whom so much had been heard.
That they did not come in vain, we in London knew one
July morning as we opened our papers.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Pushing the Chisel</span> (<i>Free Style</i>).</p>

<p><small>"1. P. Riley (Great Britain), 5-3/4 in. (World's Record). 2. H.
Biffpoffer (America), 5-1/2 in. A. Wafer (America) was disqualified
for going outside the wood."</small></p></div>

<hr class="min" />

<p>And so England was herself again. There was only
one discordant note in her triumph. Mr. P. A. Vaile
pointed out in all the papers that Peter Riley, in the
usual pig-headed English way, had been employing
entirely the wrong grip. Mr. Vaile's book, <i>How to Push
the Chisel</i>, illustrated with 50 full plates of Mr. Vaile in
knickerbockers pushing the Chisel, explained the
correct method.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_BIRTHDAY_PRESENT" id="THE_BIRTHDAY_PRESENT"></a>THE BIRTHDAY PRESENT</h3>

<p class="cap">"<span class="dcap">It's</span> my birthday to-morrow," said Mrs. Jeremy
as she turned the pages of her engagement book.</p>

<p>"Bless us, so it is," said Jeremy. "You're thirty-nine
or twenty-seven or something. I must go and
examine the wine-cellar. I believe there's one bottle
left in the Apollinaris bin. It's the only stuff in the
house that fizzes."</p>

<p>"Jeremy! I'm only twenty-six."</p>

<p>"You don't look it, darling; I mean you do look
it, dear. What I mean&mdash;well, never mind that. Let's
talk about birthday presents. Think of something
absolutely tremendous for me to give you."</p>

<p>"A rope of pearls."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that sort of tremendousness," said
Jeremy quickly. "Anyone could give you a rope of
pearls; it's simply a question of overdrawing enough
from the bank. I meant something difficult that would
really prove my love for you&mdash;like Lloyd George's ear
or the Kaiser's cigar-holder. Something where I
could kill somebody for you first. I am in a very
devoted mood this morning."</p>

<p>"Are you really?" smiled Mrs. Jeremy. "Because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am. So is Baby, unfortunately. She will probably
want to give you something horribly expensive.
Between ourselves, dear, I shall be glad when Baby
is old enough to buy her own presents for her mamma.
Last Christmas her idea of a complete edition of
Meredith and a pair of silver-backed brushes nearly
ruined me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"You won't be ruined this time, Jeremy. I don't
want you to give me anything; I want you to show
that devotion of yours by <i>doing</i> something for me."</p>

<p>"Anything," said Jeremy grandly. "Shall I swim
the Channel? I was practising my new trudgeon
stroke in the bath this morning." He got up from his
chair and prepared to give an exhibition of it.</p>

<p>"No, nothing like that." Mrs. Jeremy hesitated,
looked anxiously at him, and then went boldly at it.
"I want you to go in for that physical culture that
everyone's talking about."</p>

<p>"Who's everyone? Cook hasn't said a word to me
on the subject; neither has Baby; neither has&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hodgkin was talking to me about it yesterday.
She was saying how thin you were looking."</p>

<p>"The scandal that goes on in these villages," sighed
Jeremy. "And the Vicar's wife too. Dear, all this is
weeks and weeks old; I suppose it has only just reached
the Vicarage. Do let us be up-to-date. Physical
culture has been quite <i>d&eacute;mod&eacute;</i> since last Thursday."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> never saw anything in the paper"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Knowing what wives are, I hid it from you. Let
us now, my dear wife, talk of something else."</p>

<p>"Jeremy! Not for my birthday present?" said his
wife in a reproachful voice. "The Vicar does them
every morning," she added casually.</p>

<p>"Poor beggar! But it's what Vicars are for."
Jeremy chuckled to himself. "I should love to see
him," he said. "I suppose it's private, though.
Perhaps if I said 'Press'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> thin, you know."</p>

<p>"My dear, the proper way to get fat is not to take
violent exercise, but to lie in a hammock all day and
drink milk. Besides, do you want a fat husband?
Does Baby want a fat father? You wouldn't like, at
your next garden party, to have everybody asking
you in a whisper, 'Who is the enormously stout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
gentleman?' If Nature made me thin&mdash;or, to be
more accurate, slender and of a pleasing litheness&mdash;let
us believe that she knew best."</p>

<p>"It isn't only thinness; these exercises keep you
young and well and active in mind."</p>

<p>"Like the Vicar?"</p>

<p>"He's only just begun," said his wife hastily.</p>

<p>"Let's wait a bit and watch him," suggested
Jeremy. "If his sermons really get better, then I'll
think about it seriously. I make you a present of his
baldness; I shan't ask for any improvement there."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jeremy went over to her husband and patted
the top of his head.</p>

<p>"'In a very devoted mood this morning,'" she
quoted.</p>

<p>Jeremy looked unhappy.</p>

<p>"What pains me most about this," he said, "is the
revelation of your shortcomings as a wife. You ought
to think me the picture of manly beauty. Baby does.
She thinks that, next to the postman, I am one of
the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you are, dear."</p>

<p>"Well, why not leave it? Really, I can't waste my
time fattening refined gold and stoutening the lily.
I am a busy man. I walk up and down the pergola, I
keep a dog, I paint little water-colours, I am treasurer
of the cricket club; my life is full of activities."</p>

<p>"This only takes a quarter of an hour before your
bath, Jeremy."</p>

<p>"I am shaving then; I should cut myself and get
all the soap in my eyes. It would be most dangerous.
When you were a widow, and Baby and the pony were
orphans, you and Mrs. Hodgkin would be sorry. But
it would be too late. The Vicar, tearing himself away
from Position 5 to conduct the funeral service&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jeremy, <i>don't</i>!"</p>

<p>"Ah, woman, now I move you. You are beginning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
to see what you were in danger of doing. Death I
laugh at; but a fat death&mdash;the death of a stout man
who has swallowed the shaving-brush through taking
too deep a breath before beginning Exercise 3, that is
more than I can bear."</p>

<p>"Jeremy!"</p>

<p>"When I said I wanted to kill someone for you, I
didn't think you would suggest myself, least of all
that you wanted me fattened up like a Christmas
turkey first. To go down to posterity as the large-bodied
gentleman who inhaled the badger's hair; to
be billed in the London press in the words, 'Curious
Fatal Accident to Adipose Treasurer'&mdash;to do this
simply by way of celebrating your twenty-sixth
birthday, when we actually have a bottle of Apollinaris
left in the Apollinaris bin&mdash;darling, you cannot
have been thinking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His wife patted his head again gently. "Oh,
Jeremy, you hopeless person," she sighed. "Give me
a new sunshade. I want one badly."</p>

<p>"No," said Jeremy, "Baby shall give you that.
For myself I am still feeling that I should like to kill
somebody for you. Lloyd George? No. F. E.
Smith? N-no...." He rubbed his head thoughtfully.
"Who invented those exercises?" he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>"A German, I think."</p>

<p>"Then," said Jeremy, buttoning up his coat, "I
shall go and kill <i>him</i>."</p>

<h3><a name="ONE_OF_OUR_SUFFERERS" id="ONE_OF_OUR_SUFFERERS"></a>ONE OF OUR SUFFERERS</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There</span> is no question before the country of
more importance than that of National Health.
In my own small way I have made something
of a study of it, and when a Royal Commission begins
its enquiries, I shall put before it the evidence which
I have accumulated. I shall lay particular stress upon
the health of Thomson.</p>

<p>"You'll beat me to-day," he said, as he swung his
club stiffly on the first tee; "I shan't be able to hit a
ball."</p>

<p>"You should have some lessons," I suggested.</p>

<p>Thomson gave a snort of indignation.</p>

<p>"It's not <i>that</i>," he said. "But I've been very seedy
lately, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right; I shan't mind. I haven't played
a thoroughly well man for a month, now."</p>

<p>"You know, I think my liver&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I held up my hand.</p>

<p>"Not before my caddie, please," I said severely;
"he is quite a child."</p>

<p>Thomson said no more for the moment, but hit his
ball hard and straight along the ground.</p>

<p>"It's perfectly absurd," he said with a shrug; "I
shan't be able to give you a game at all. Well, if you
don't mind playing a sick man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not if you don't mind being one," I replied, and
drove a ball which also went along the ground, but not
so far as my opponent's. "There! I'm about the
only man in England who can do that when he's quite
well."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>The ball was sitting up nicely for my second shot,
and I managed to put it on the green. Thomson's,
fifty yards farther on, was reclining in the worst part
of a bunker which he had forgotten about.</p>

<p>"Well, really," he said, "there's an example of luck
for you. <i>Your</i> ball&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't do it on purpose," I pleaded. "Don't be
angry with me."</p>

<p>He made two attempts to get out, and then picked
his ball up. We walked in silence to the second tee.</p>

<p>"This time," I said, "I shall hit the sphere
properly," and with a terrific swing I stroked it gently
into a gorse bush. I looked at the thing in disgust
and then felt my pulse. Apparently I was still quite
well. Thomson, forgetting about his liver, drove a
beauty. We met on the green.</p>

<p>"Five," I said.</p>

<p>"Only five?" asked Thomson suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Six," I said, holing a very long putt.</p>

<p>Thomson's health had a relapse. He took four short
putts and was down in seven.</p>

<p>"It's really rather absurd," he said, in a conversational
way, as we went to the next tee, "that putting
should be so ridiculously important. Take that hole,
for instance. I get on the green in a perfect three;
you fluff your drive completely and get on in&mdash;what
was it?"</p>

<p>"Five," I said again.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;five. And yet you win the hole. It <i>is</i> rather
absurd, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I've often thought so," I admitted readily. "That
is to say, when I've taken four putts. I'm two up."</p>

<p>On the third tee Thomson's health became positively
alarming. He missed the ball altogether.</p>

<p>"It's ridiculous to try to play," he said, with a forced
laugh. "I can't see the ball at all."</p>

<p>"It's still there," I assured him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>He struck at it again and it hurried off into a ditch.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "wouldn't you rather play
the pro.? This is not much of a match for you."</p>

<p>I considered. Of course, a game with the pro.
would be much pleasanter than a game with Thomson,
but ought I to leave him in his present serious condition
of health? His illness was approaching its critical stage,
and it was my duty to pull him through if I could.</p>

<p>"No, no," I said. "Let's go on. The fresh air
will do you good."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will," he said hopefully. "I'm sorry
I'm like this, but I've had a cold hanging about for
some days, and that on the top of my liver&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite so," I said.</p>

<p>The climax was reached, at the next hole, when, with
several strokes in hand, he topped his approach shot
into a bunker. For my sake he tried to look as though
he had <i>meant</i> to run it up along the ground, having
forgotten about the intervening hazard. It was a brave
effort to hide from me the real state of his health, but he
soon saw that it was hopeless. He sighed and pressed
his hand to his eyes. Then he held his fingers a foot
away from him, and looked at them as if he were
trying to count them correctly. His state was pitiable,
and I felt that at any cost I must save him.</p>

<p>I did. The corner was turned at the fifth, where I
took four putts.</p>

<p>"You aren't going to win <i>all</i> the holes," he said
grudgingly, as he ran down his putt.</p>

<p>Convalescence set in at the sixth, when I got into an
impossible place and picked up.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I shall give you a game yet," he said.
"Two down."</p>

<p>The need for further bulletins ceased at the seventh
hole, which he played really well and won easily.</p>

<p>"A-ha, you won't beat me by <i>much</i>," he said, "in
spite of my liver."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"By the way, how <i>is</i> the liver?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Your fresh-air cure is doing it good. Of course, it
may come on again, but&mdash;&mdash;" He drove a screamer.
"I think I shall be all right," he announced.</p>

<p>"All square," he said cheerily at the ninth. "I
fancy I'm going to beat you now. Not bad, you
know, considering you were four up. Practically
speaking, I gave you a start of four holes."</p>

<p>I decided that it was time to make an effort again,
seeing that Thomson's health was now thoroughly re-established.
Of the next seven holes I managed to
win three and halve two. It is only fair to say, though
(as Thomson did several times), that I had an extraordinary
amount of good luck, and that he was dogged
by ill-fortune throughout. But this, after all, is as
nothing so long as one's health is above suspicion. The
great thing was that Thomson's liver suffered no relapse;
even though, at the seventeenth tee, he was
one down and two to play.</p>

<p>And it was on the seventeenth tee that I had to
think seriously how I wanted the match to end.
Thomson at lunch when he has won is a very different
man from Thomson at lunch when he has lost. The
more I thought about it, the more I realized that I was
in rather a happy position. If I won, I won&mdash;which
was jolly; if I lost, Thomson won&mdash;and we should
have a pleasant lunch.</p>

<p>However, as it happened, the match was halved.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was afraid so," said Thomson; "I let you
get too long a start. It's absurd to suppose that I
can give you four holes up and beat you. It practically
amounts to giving you four bisques. Four bisques is
about six strokes&mdash;I'm not really six strokes better
than you."</p>

<p>"What about lunch?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Good; and you can have your revenge afterwards."
He led the way into the pavilion. "Now I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
wonder," he said, "what I can safely eat. I want to
be able to give you <i>some</i> sort of a game this afternoon."</p>

<p>Well, if there is ever a Royal Commission upon the
national physique I shall insist on giving evidence.
For it seems to me that golf, far from improving the
health of the country, is actually undermining it.
Thomson, at any rate, since he has taken to the game,
has never been quite fit.</p>

<p class="cap">"<span class="dcap">Do</span> you tango?" asked Miss Hopkins, as
soon as we were comfortably seated. I
know her name was Hopkins, because I
had her down on my programme as Popkins, which
seemed too good to be true; and, in order to give her a
chance of reconsidering it, I had asked her if she was
one of the Popkinses of Hampshire. It had then
turned out that she was really one of the Hopkinses of
Maida Vale.</p>

<p>"No," I said, "I don't." She was only the fifth
person who had asked me, but then she was only my
fifth partner.</p>

<p>"Oh, you ought to. You must be up-to-date, you
know."</p>

<p>"I'm always a bit late with these things," I explained.
"The waltz came to England in 1812, but
I didn't really master it till 1904."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid if you wait as long as that before you
master the tango it will be out."</p>

<p>"That's what I thought. By the time I learnt the
tango, the bingo would be in. My idea was to learn
the bingo in advance, so as to be ready for it. Think
how you'll all envy me in 1917. Think how Society
will flock to my Bingo Quick Lunches. I shall be the
only man in London who bingoes properly. Of course,
by 1918 you'll all be at it."</p>

<p>"Then we must have one together in 1918," smiled
Miss Hopkins.</p>

<p>"In 1918," I pointed out coldly, "I shall be learning
the pongo."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>My next partner had no name that I could discover,
but a fund of conversation.</p>

<p>"Do you tango?" she asked me as soon as we were
comfortably seated.</p>

<p>"No," I said, "I don't. But," I added, "I once
learned the minuet."</p>

<p>"Oh, they're not very much alike, are they?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. However, luckily that doesn't matter,
because I've forgotten all the steps now."</p>

<p>She seemed a little puzzled and decided to change the
subject.</p>

<p>"Are you going to learn the tango?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't think so. It took me four months to learn
the minuet."</p>

<p>"But they're quite different, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Quite," I agreed.</p>

<p>As she seemed to have exhausted herself for the
moment, it was obviously my business to say something.
There was only one thing to say.</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> tango?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I don't."</p>

<p>"Are you going to learn?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said; and five minutes later we parted
for ever.</p>

<p>The next dance really was a tango, and I saw to my
horror that I had a name down for it. With some
difficulty I found the owner of it, and prepared to
explain to her that unfortunately I couldn't dance the
tango, but that for profound conversation about it I
was undoubtedly the man. Luckily she explained
first.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't do this," she apologised. "I'm
so sorry."</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said magnanimously. "We'll sit it
out."</p>

<p>We found a comfortable seat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you tango?" she asked.</p>

<p>I was tired of saying "No."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you wouldn't like to find somebody
else to do it with?"</p>

<p>"Quite, thanks. The fact is I do it rather differently
from the way they're doing it here to-night. You see,
I actually learnt it in the Argentine."</p>

<p>She was very much interested to hear this.</p>

<p>"Really? Are you out there much? I've got an
uncle living there now. I wonder if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When I say I learnt it in the Argentine," I explained,
"I mean that I was actually taught it in St.
John's Wood, but that my dancing mistress came
from&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In St. John's Wood?" she said eagerly. "But
how funny! My sister is learning there. I wonder
if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was a very difficult person to talk to. Her
relations seemed to spread themselves all over the
place.</p>

<p>"Perhaps that is hardly doing justice to the situation,"
I explained again. "It would be more accurate
to put it like this. When I decided&mdash;by the way, does
your family frequent Paris? No? Good. Well,
when I decided to learn the tango, the fact that my
friends the Hopkinses of St. John's Wood, or rather
Maida Vale, had already learnt it in Paris naturally
led me to&mdash;&mdash; I say, what about an ice? It's getting
awfully hot in here."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll go and get them," I said hastily; and I went
and took a long time getting them, and, as it turned out
that she didn't want hers after all, a longer time eating
them. When I was ready for conversation again the
next dance was beginning. With a bow I relinquished
her to another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come along," said a bright voice behind me;
"this is ours."</p>

<p>"Hallo, Norah, is that you? Come on."</p>

<p>We hurried in, danced in silence, and then found
ourselves a comfortable seat. For a moment neither
of us spoke....</p>

<p>"Have you learnt the tango yet?" asked Norah.</p>

<p>"Fourteen," I said aloud.</p>

<p>"Help! Does that mean that I'm the fourteenth
person who has asked you?"</p>

<p>"The night is yet young, Norah. You are only the
eighth. But I was betting that you'd ask me before I
counted twenty. You lost, and you owe me a pair of
ivory-backed hair-brushes and a cigar-cutter."</p>

<p>"Bother! Anyhow, I'm not going to be stopped
talking about the tango if I want to. Did you know I
was learning? I can do the scissors."</p>

<p>"Good. We'll do the new Fleet Street movement
together, the scissors-and-paste. You go into the ball-room
and do the scissors, and I'll&mdash;er&mdash;stick here and
do the paste."</p>

<p>"Can't you really do any of it at all, and aren't you
going to learn?"</p>

<p>"I can't do any of it at all, Norah. I am not going
to learn, Norah."</p>

<p>"It isn't so very difficult, you know. I'd teach you
myself for tuppence."</p>

<p>"Will you stop talking about it for threepence?"
I asked, and I took out three coppers.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>I sighed and put them back again.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>It was the last dance of the evening. My hostess,
finding me lonely, had dragged me up to somebody, and
I and whatever her name was were in the supper-room
drinking our farewell soup. So far we had said nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
to each other. I waited anxiously for her to begin.
Suddenly she began.</p>

<p>"Have you thought about Christmas presents yet?"
she asked.</p>

<p>I nearly swooned. With difficulty I remained in an
upright position. She was the first person who had not
begun by asking me if I danced the tango!</p>

<p>"Excuse me," I said. "I'm afraid I didn't&mdash;would
you tell me your name again?"</p>

<p>I felt that it ought to be celebrated in some way. I
had some notion of writing a sonnet to her.</p>

<p>"Hopkins," she said; "I knew you'd forgotten
me."</p>

<p>"Of course I haven't," I said, suddenly remembering
her. The sonnet would never be written now. "We
had a dance together before."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Let me see," she added, "I did
ask you if you danced the tango, didn't I?"</p>

<h3><a name="THE_HEIR2" id="THE_HEIR2"></a>THE HEIR</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Mr. Trevor Pilkington</span>, of the well-known
firm of Trevor Pilkington, fixed his
horn spectacles carefully upon his nose, took
a pinch of snuff, sneezed twice, gave his papers a preliminary
rustle, looked slowly round the crowded
room, and began to read the will. Through forty
years of will-reading his method of procedure had
always been the same. But Jack Summers, who was
sharing an ottoman with two of the outdoor servants,
thought that Mr. Pilkington's mannerisms were
designed specially to annoy him, and he could scarcely
control his impatience.</p>

<p>Yet no one ever had less to hope from the reading
of a will than Jack. For the first twenty years of his
life his parents had brought him up to believe that his
cousin Cecil was heir to his Uncle Alfred's enormous
fortune, and for the subsequent ten years his cousin
Cecil had brought his Uncle Alfred up in the same belief.
Indeed, Cecil had even roughed out one or two wills
for signature, and had offered to help his uncle&mdash;who,
however, preferred to do these things by himself&mdash;to
hold the pen. Jack could not help feeling glad that his
cousin was not there to parade his approaching
triumph; a nasty cold, caught a week previously in
attending his uncle to the Lord Mayor's Show, having
kept Cecil in bed.</p>

<p>"To the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children, ten shillings and sixpence"&mdash;the words came
to him in a meaningless drone&mdash;"to the Fresh Air
Fund, ten shillings and sixpence; to the King Edward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Hospital Fund, ten shillings and sixpence"&mdash;was <i>all</i>
the money going in charities?&mdash;"to my nephew Cecil
Linley, who has taken such care of me"&mdash;Mr. Pilkington
hesitated&mdash;"four shillings and ninepence; to my
nephew, John Summers, whom, thank Heaven, I have
never seen, five million pounds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A long whistle of astonishment came from the
ottoman. The solicitor looked up with a frown.</p>

<p>"It's the surprise," apologised Jack. "I hardly
expected so much. I thought that that brute&mdash;I mean
I thought my cousin Cecil had nobbled&mdash;that is to say,
was getting it all."</p>

<p>"The late Mr. Alfred made three wills," said the
lawyer in a moment of expansion. "In the first he
left his nephew Cecil a legacy of one shilling and tenpence,
in the second he bequeathed him a sum of three
shillings and twopence, and in the last he set aside the
amount of four shillings and ninepence. The evidence
seems to show that your cousin was rapidly rising in
his uncle's estimation. You, on the other hand, have
always been a legatee to the amount of five million
pounds; but in the last will there is a trifling condition
attached." He resumed his papers. "To my nephew,
John Summers, five million pounds, on condition that,
within one year from the date of my death, he marries
Mary Huggins, the daughter of my old friend, now
deceased, William Huggins."</p>

<p>Jack Summers rose proudly from his end of the
ottoman.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said curtly. "That tears it. It's
very kind of the old gentleman, but I prefer to choose
a wife for myself." He bowed to the company and
strode from the room.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>It was a cloudless August day. In the shadow of the
great elms that fringed the Sussex lane a girl sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
musing; on its side in the grass at her feet a bicycle, its
back wheel deflated. She sat on the grassy bank with
her hat in her lap, quite content to wait until the first
passer-by with a repairing outfit in his pocket should
offer to help her.</p>

<p>"Can I be of any assistance?" said a manly voice,
suddenly waking her from her reverie.</p>

<p>She turned with a start. The owner of the voice was
dressed in a stylish knickerbocker suit; his eyes were
blue, his face was tanned, his hair was curly, and he
was at least six foot tall. So much she noticed at a
glance.</p>

<p>"My bicycle," she said; "punctured."</p>

<p>In a minute he was on his knees beside the machine.
A rapid examination convinced him that she had not
over-stated the truth, and he whipped from his pocket
the repairing outfit without which he never travelled.</p>

<p>"I can do it in a moment," he said. "At least, if
you can just help me a little."</p>

<p>As she knelt beside him he could not fail to be aware
of her wonderful beauty. The repairs, somehow, took
longer than he thought. Their heads were very close
together all the time, and indeed on one occasion came
violently into contact.</p>

<p>"There," he said at last, getting up and barking his
shin against the pedal. "Conf&mdash;&mdash; That will be all
right."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said tenderly.</p>

<p>He looked at her without disguising his admiration;
a tall, straight figure in the sunlight, its right shin
rubbing itself vigorously against its left calf.</p>

<p>"It's absurd," he said at last; "I feel as if I've
known you for years. And, anyway, I'm certain I've
seen you before somewhere."</p>

<p>"Did you ever go to <i>The Seaside Girl</i>?" she asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Often."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you remember the Spanish princess who came
on at the beginning of the Second Act and said,
'Wow-wow!' to the Mayor?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course! And you had your photograph
in <i>The Sketch</i>, <i>The Tatler</i>, <i>The Bystander</i>, and <i>The
Sporting and Dramatic</i> all in the same week?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded happily. "Yes, I'm Marie Huguenot!"
she said.</p>

<p>"And I'm Jack Summers; so now we know each
other." He took her hand. "Marie," he said, "ever
since I have mended your bicycle&mdash;I mean, ever since
I have known you, I have loved you. Will you marry
me?"</p>

<p>"Jack!" she cooed. "You did say 'Jack,' didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Bless you, Marie. We shall be very poor, dear.
Will you mind?"</p>

<p>"Not with you, Jack. At least, not if you mean
what <i>I</i> mean by 'very poor.'"</p>

<p>"Two thousand a year."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's about what I meant."</p>

<p>Jack took her in his arms.</p>

<p>"And Mary Huggins can go and marry the Pope,"
he said, with a smile.</p>

<p>With a look of alarm in her eyes she pushed him
suddenly away from her. There was a crash as his
foot went through the front wheel of the bicycle.</p>

<p>"Mary Huggins?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was left a fortune on condition that I
married a person called Mary Huggins. Absurd! As
though&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite a lot if it wasn't for these confounded
death duties. Five million pounds. You see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jack, Jack!" cried the girl. "Don't you understand?
<i>I</i> am Mary Huggins."</p>

<p>He looked at her in amazement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>"You said your name was Marie Huguenot," he said
slowly.</p>

<p>"My stage name, dear. Naturally I couldn't&mdash;I
mean, one must&mdash;you know how particular managers
are. When father died and I had to go on the stage
for a living&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Marie, my darling!"</p>

<p>Mary rose and picked up her bicycle. The air had
gone out of the back wheel again, and there were four
spokes broken, but she did not heed it.</p>

<p>"You must write to your lawyer to-night," she said.
"<i>Won't</i> he be surprised?"</p>

<p>But, being a great reader of the magazines, he
wasn't.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_STATESMAN" id="THE_STATESMAN"></a>THE STATESMAN</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">On</span> a certain night in the middle of the season
all London was gathered in Lady Marchpane's
drawing-room; all London, that is, which was
worth knowing&mdash;a qualification which accounted for
the absence of several million people who had never
heard of Lady Marchpane. In one corner of the room
an Ambassador, with a few ribbons across his chest,
could have been seen chatting to the latest American
Duchess; in another corner one of our largest Advertisers
was exchanging epigrams with a titled
Newspaper Proprietor. Famous Generals rubbed
shoulders with Post-Impressionist Artists; Financiers
whispered sweet nothings to Breeders of prize Poms;
even an Actor-Manager might have been seen accepting
an apology from a Royalty who had jostled him.</p>

<p>"Hallo," said Algy Lascelles, catching sight of the
dignified figure of Rupert Meryton in the crowd;
"how's William?"</p>

<p>A rare smile lit up Rupert's distinguished features.
He was Under Secretary for Invasion Affairs, and
"William" was Algy's pleasant way of referring to the
Bill which he was now piloting through the House of
Commons. It was a measure for doing something or
other by means of a what-d'you-call-it&mdash;I cannot be
more precise without precipitating a European Conflict.</p>

<p>"I think we shall get it through," said Rupert
calmly.</p>

<p>"Lady Marchpane was talking about it just now.
She's rather interested, you know."</p>

<p>Rupert's lips closed about his mouth in a firm line.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
He looked over Algy's head into the crowd. "Oh!"
he said coldly.</p>

<p>It was barely ten years ago that young Meryton,
just down from Oxford, had startled the political world
by capturing the important seat of Cricklewood (E.)
for the Tariffadicals&mdash;as, to avoid plunging the country
into Civil War, I must call them. This was at a by-election,
and the Liberatives had immediately dissolved,
only to come into power after the General
Election with an increased majority. Through the
years that followed, Rupert Meryton, by his pertinacity
in asking the Invasion Secretary questions which had
been answered by him on the previous day, and by his
regard for the dignity of the House, as shown in his
invariable comment, "Come, come&mdash;not quite the
gentleman," upon any display of bad manners opposite,
established a clear right to a post in the subsequent
Tariffadical Government. He had now been Under
Secretary for two years, and in this Bill his first real
chance had come.</p>

<p>"Oh, there you are, Mr. Meryton," said a voice.
"Come and talk to me a moment." With a nod to a
couple of Archbishops Lady Marchpane led the way
to a little gallery whither the crowd had not penetrated.
Priceless Correggios, Tintorettos, and G. K. Chestertons
hung upon the walls, but it was not to show him these
that she had come. Dropping into a wonderful old
Chippendale chair, she motioned him to a Blundell-Maple
opposite her, and looked at him with a curious
smile.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "about the Bill?"</p>

<p>Rupert's lips closed about his mouth in a firm line.
(He was rather good at this.) Folding his arms, he
gazed steadily into Lady Marchpane's still beautiful
eyes.</p>

<p>"It will go through," he said. "Through all its
stages," he added professionally.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must not go through," said Lady Marchpane
gently.</p>

<p>Rupert could not repress a start, but he was master
of himself again in a moment.</p>

<p>"I cannot add anything to my previous statement,"
he said.</p>

<p>"If it goes through," began Lady Marchpane&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I must refer you," said Rupert, "to my answer of
yesterday."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Mr. Meryton, what is the good of
fencing with me? You know the position. Or shall I
state it for you again?"</p>

<p>"I cannot believe you are serious."</p>

<p>"I am perfectly serious. There are reasons, financial
reasons&mdash;and others&mdash;why I do not want this Bill to
pass. In return for my silence upon a certain matter,
you are going to prevent it passing. You know to what
I refer. On the 4th of May last&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Rupert hoarsely.</p>

<p>"On the 4th of May last," Lady Marchpane went on
relentlessly, "you and I&mdash;in the absence of my husband
abroad&mdash;had tea together at an A.B.C." (Rupert
covered his face with his hands.) "I am no fonder of
scandal than you are, but if you do not meet my
wishes I shall certainly confess the truth to Marchpane."</p>

<p>"You will be ruined too!" said Rupert.</p>

<p>"My husband will forgive me and take me back."
She paused significantly. "Will Marjorie Hale&mdash;&mdash;"
(Rupert covered his hands with his face)&mdash;"will the
good Miss Hale forgive you? She is very strict, is she
not? And rich? And rising young politicians want
money more than scandal." She raised her head suddenly
at the sound of footsteps. "Ah, Archbishop, I
was just calling Mr. Meryton's attention to this
wonderful Botticell&mdash;&mdash;" (she looked at it more
closely)&mdash;&mdash;"this wonderful Dana Gibson. A beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
piece of work, is it not?" The intruders passed on to
the supper-room, and they were alone again.</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" said Rupert sullenly.</p>

<p>"The fate of the Bill is settled to-day week, when
you make your big speech. You must speak against
it. Confess frankly you were mistaken. It will be a
close thing, anyhow. Your influence will turn the
scale."</p>

<p>"It will ruin me politically."</p>

<p>"You will marry Marjorie Hale and be rich. No
rich man is ever ruined politically. Or socially." She
patted his hand gently. "You'll do it?"</p>

<p>He got up slowly. "You'll see next week," he said.</p>

<p>It is not meet that we should watch the unhappy
Rupert through the long-drawn hours of the night, as
he wrestled with the terrible problem. A moment's
sudden madness on that May afternoon had brought
him to the cross-roads. On the one hand, reputation,
wealth, the girl that he loved; on the other, his own
honour and&mdash;so, at least, he had said several times
on the platform&mdash;the safety of England. He rose in
the morning weary, but with his mind made up.</p>

<p>The Bill should go through!</p>

<p>Rupert Meryton was a speaker of a not unusual
type. Although he provided the opinions himself, he
always depended upon his secretary for the arguments
with which to support them and the actual words in
which to give them being. But on this occasion he felt
that a special effort was required of him. He would
show Lady Marchpane that the blackmail of yesterday
had only roused him to a still greater effort on behalf
of his country. <i>He would write his own speech.</i></p>

<p>On the fateful night the House was crowded. It
seemed that all the guests at Lady Marchpane's a
week before were in the Distinguished Strangers'
Gallery or behind the Ladies' Grille. From the Press
Gallery "Our Special Word-painter" looked down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
upon the statesmen beneath him, his eagle eye ready
to detect on the moment the Angry Flush, the Wince,
or the Sudden Paling of enemy, the Grim Smile or
the Lofty Calm of friend.</p>

<p>The Rt. Hon. Rupert Meryton, Tariffadical Member
for Cricklewood (E.) rose to his feet amidst cheers.</p>

<p>"Mr. Speaker," he said, "I rise&mdash;er&mdash;to-night, sir&mdash;h'r'm,
to&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;" So much of his speech I may give,
but urgent State reasons compel me to withhold the
rest. Were it ever known with which Bill the secret
history that I have disclosed concerns itself, the Great
Powers in an instant would be at each other's throats.
But though I may not disclose the speech I can tell
of its effect on the House. And its effect was curious.
It was, in fact, the exact opposite of what Rupert
Meryton, that promising Under Secretary, had intended.</p>

<p>It was the first speech that he had ever prepared
himself. Than Rupert there was no more dignified
figure in the House of Commons; his honour was proof,
as we have seen, against the most insidious temptations;
yet, since one man cannot have all the virtues, he was
distinctly stupid. It would have been a hopeless speech
anyhow; but, to make matters worse, he had, in the
most important part of it, attempted irony. And at
the beginning of the ironical passage even the Tariffadical
word-painters had to confess that it was their
own stalwarts who "suddenly paled."</p>

<p>As Lady Marchpane had said, it was bound to be a
close thing. The Liberatives and the Unialists, of
course, were solid against the Bill, but there was also
something of a cave in the Tariffadical Party. It was
bound to be a close thing, and Rupert's speech just
made the difference. When he sat down the waverers
and doubters had made up their minds.</p>

<p>The Bill was defeated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p><hr class="min" />

<p>That the Tariffadicals should resign was natural;
perhaps it was equally natural that Rupert's secretary
should resign too. He said that his reputation would
be gone if Rupert made any more speeches on his own,
and that he wasn't going to risk it. Without his
secretary Rupert was lost at the General Election
which followed. Fortunately he had a grateful friend
in Lady Marchpane. She exerted her influence with
the Liberatives, and got him an appointment as
Governor of the Stickjaw Islands. Here, with his
beautiful and rich wife, Sir Rupert Meryton maintains
a regal state, and upon his name no breath of scandal
rests. Indeed, his only trouble so far has been with the
Stickjaw language&mdash;a difficult language, but one which,
perhaps fortunately, does not lend itself to irony.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_MAGNATE" id="THE_MAGNATE"></a>THE MAGNATE</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> was in October, 19&mdash; that the word "Zinc"
first began to be heard in financial circles. City
men, pushing their dominoes regretfully away, and
murmuring "Zinc" in apologetic tones, were back
in their offices by three o'clock, forgetting in their
haste to leave the usual twopence under the cup for the
waitress. Clubmen, glancing at the tape on their way
to the smoking-room, said to their neighbours, "Zinc's
moved a point, I see," before covering themselves up
with <i>The Times</i>. In the trains, returning husbands
asked each other loudly, "What's all this about
zinc?"&mdash;all save the very innocent ones, who whispered,
"I say, what <i>is</i> zinc exactly?" The music-halls
took it up. No sooner had the word "Zinc"
left the lips of an acknowledged comedian than the
house was in roars of laughter. The <i>furore</i> at the
Collodium when Octavius Octo, in his world-famous
part of the landlady of a boarding-house, remarked,
"I know why my ole man's so late. 'E's buying zinc,"
is still remembered in the bars round Piccadilly.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>To explain it properly it will be necessary (my readers
will be alarmed to hear) to go back some thirty years.
This, as a simple calculation shows, takes us to June,
18&mdash;. It was in June, 18&mdash; that Felix Moses, a stout
young man of attractive appearance (if you care for
that style), took his courage in both hands, and told
Phyllida Sloan that he was worth ten thousand a year
and was changing his name to Mountenay. Miss Sloan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
seeing that it was the beginning of a proposal, said
hastily that she was changing hers to Abraham.</p>

<p>"You're marrying Leo Abraham?" asked Felix in
amazement. "Ah!" A gust of jealousy swept over
him. He licked his lips. There was a dangerous look
in his eyes&mdash;a look that was destined in after days to
make Emperors and rival financiers quail. "Ah!" he
said softly. "Leo Abraham! I shall not forget!"</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>And now it will be necessary (my readers will be
relieved to learn) to jump forward some thirty years.
This obviously takes us to September 19&mdash;. Let us
on this fine September morning take a peep into
"No. &mdash; Throgneedle Street, E.C.," and see how the
business of the mother city is carried on.</p>

<p>On the fourth floor we come to the sanctum of the
great man himself. "Mr. Felix Mountenay&mdash;No
admittance," is painted upon the outer door. It is a
name which is known and feared all over Europe.
Mr. Mountenay's private detective stands on one side
of the door; on the other side is Mr. Mountenay's
private wolf-hound. Murmuring the word "Press,"
however, we pass hastily through, and find ourselves
before Mr. Mountenay himself. Mr. Mountenay is at
work; let us watch him through a typical five
minutes.</p>

<p>For a moment he stands meditating in the middle
of the room. Kings are tottering on their thrones.
Empires hang upon his nod. What will he decide?
Suddenly he blows a cloud of smoke from his cigar,
and rushes to the telephone.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Is that you, Jones?... What are
Margarine Prefs. at?... <i>What?...</i> No, Margarine
<i>Prefs.</i>, idiot.... Ah! Then sell. Keep on selling
till I tell you to stop.... Yes."</p>

<p>He hangs up the receiver. For two minutes he paces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the room, smoking rapidly. He stops a moment ...
but it is only to remove his cigar-band, which is in
danger of burning. Then he resumes his pacings.
Another minute goes rapidly by. He rushes to the
telephone again.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Is that you, Jones?... What are
Margarine Prefs. down to now?... Ah! Then buy.
Keep on buying.... Yes."</p>

<p>He hangs up the receiver. By this master-stroke he
has made a quarter of a million. It may seem to you or
me an easy way of doing it. Ah, but what, we must ask
ourselves, of the great brain that conceived the idea,
the foresight which told the exact moment when to
put it into action, the cool courage which seized the
moment&mdash;what of the grasp of affairs, the knowledge
of men? Ah! Can we grudge it him that he earns a
quarter of a million more quickly than we do?</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Felix Mountenay is not happy. When we
have brought off a coup for a hundred thousand even,
we smile gaily. Mr. Mountenay did not smile. Fiercely
he bit another inch off his cigar, and muttered to
himself.</p>

<p>The words were "Leo Abraham! Wait!"</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>This is positively the last row of dots. Let us take
advantage of them to jump forward another month.
It was October 1st, 19&mdash;. (If that was a Sunday, then
it was October 2nd. Anyhow, it was October.)</p>

<p>Mr. Felix Mountenay was sleeping in his office.
For once that iron brain relaxed. He had made a little
over three million in the last month, and the strain
was too much for him. But a knock at the door
restored him instantly to his own cool self.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," said his secretary, "but
somebody is selling zinc."</p>

<p>The word "zinc" touched a chord in Mr. Mountenay's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
brain which had lain dormant for years. Zinc!
Why did zinc remind him of Leo Abraham?</p>

<p>"Fetch the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, quick!" he
cried.</p>

<p>The secretary, a man of herculean build, returned
with some of it. With the luck which proverbially
attends rich men, Mr. Mountenay picked up the "Z"
volume at once. As he read the Zinc article it all came
back to him. Leo Abraham had owned an empty
zinc-mine! Was his enemy in his clutches at last?</p>

<p>"Buy!" he said briefly.</p>

<p>In a fortnight the secretary had returned.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Mountenay, "have you bought all
the zinc there is?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the secretary. "And a lot that
there isn't," he added.</p>

<p>"Good!" He paused a moment. "When Mr. Leo
Abraham calls," he added grimly, "show him up at
once."</p>

<p>It was a month later that a haggard man climbed the
stairs of No. &mdash; Throgneedle Street, and was shown
into Mr. Mountenay's room.</p>

<p>"Well," said the financier softly, "what can I do
for you?"</p>

<p>"I want some zinc," said Leo Abergavenny.</p>

<p>"Zinc," said Mr. Mountenay, with a smile, "is a
million pounds a ton. Or an acre, or a gallon, or however
you prefer to buy it," he added humorously.</p>

<p>Leo went white.</p>

<p>"You wish to ruin me?"</p>

<p>"I do. A promise I made to your wife some years
ago."</p>

<p>"My wife?" cried Leo. "What do you mean? I'm
not married."</p>

<p>It was Mr. Mountenay's turn to go white. He went
it.</p>

<p>"Not married? But Miss Sloan&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Leo Abergavenny sat down and mopped his face.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," he said. "I asked
Miss Sloan to marry me, and told her I was changing
my name to Abergavenny. And she said that she was
changing hers to Moses. Naturally, I thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Mr. Mountenay. He sat down
heavily. Something seemed to have gone out of his
life; in a moment the world was empty. He looked
up at his old rival, and forced a laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said; "she deceived us both.
Let us drink to our lucky escape." He rang the bell.</p>

<p>"And then," he said in a purring voice, "we can
have a little talk about zinc. After all, business is still
business."</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DOCTOR" id="THE_DOCTOR"></a>THE DOCTOR</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">His</span> slippered feet stretched out luxuriously
to the fire, Dr. Venables, of Mudford, lay
back in his arm-chair and gave himself up to
the delights of his Flor di Cabajo, No. 2, a box of which
had been presented to him by an apparently grateful
patient. It had been a busy day. He had prescribed
more than half a dozen hot milk-puddings and a dozen
changes of air; he had promised a score of times to
look in again to-morrow; and the Widow Nixey had
told him yet again, but at greater length than before,
her private opinion of doctors.</p>

<p>Sometimes Gordon Venables wondered whether it
was only for this that he had been the most notable
student of his year at St. Bartholomew's. His brilliance,
indeed, had caused something of a sensation in
medical circles, and a remarkable career had been
prophesied for him. It was Venables who had broken
up one Suffrage meeting after another by throwing
white mice at the women on the platform; who day
after day had paraded London dressed in the costume
of a brown dog, until arrested for biting an anti-vivisector
in the leg. No wonder that all the prizes
of the profession were announced to be within his grasp,
and that when he buried himself in the little country
town of Mudford he was thought to have thrown away
recklessly opportunities such as were granted to few.</p>

<p>He had been in Mudford for five years now. An
occasional paper in <i>The Lancet</i> on "The Recurrence of
Anthro-philomelitis in Earth-worms" kept him in
touch with modern medical thought, but he could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
help feeling that to some extent his powers were rusting
in Mudford. As the years went on his chance of Harley
Street dwindled.</p>

<p>"Come in," he said in answer to a knock at the door.</p>

<p>The housekeeper's head appeared.</p>

<p>"There's been an accident, sir," she gasped.
"Gentleman run over!"</p>

<p>He snatched up his stethoscope and, without even
waiting to inquire where the accident was, hurried
into the night. Something whispered to him that his
chance had come.</p>

<p>After a quarter of an hour he stopped a small boy.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Johnny," he said breathlessly, "where's
the accident?"</p>

<p>The boy looked at him with open mouth for some
moments. Then he had an idea.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Doctor!" he said.</p>

<p>Dr. Venables pushed him over and ran on....</p>

<p>It was in the High Street that the accident had
happened. Lord Lair, an eccentric old gentleman who
sometimes walked when he might have driven, had,
while dodging a motor-car, been run into by a child's
hoop. He lay now on the pavement surrounded by a
large and interested crowd.</p>

<p>"Look out," shouted somebody from the outskirts;
"here comes Doctor."</p>

<p>Dr. Venables pushed his way through to his patient.
His long search for the scene of the accident had
exhausted him bodily, but his mind was as clear as ever.</p>

<p>"Stand back there," he said in an authoritative
voice. Then, taking out his stethoscope, he made a
rapid examination of his patient.</p>

<p>"Incised wound in the tibia," he murmured to
himself. "Slight abrasion of the patella and contusion
of the left ankle. The injuries are serious but not
necessarily mortal. Who is he?"</p>

<p>The butcher, who had been sitting on the head of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
fallen man, got up and disclosed the features of Lord
Lair. Dr. Venables staggered back.</p>

<p>"His lordship!" he cried. "He is a patient of
Dr. Scott's! I have attended the client of another
practitioner! Professionally I am ruined!"</p>

<p>Lord Lair, who was now breathing more easily,
opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Take me home," he groaned.</p>

<p>Dr. Venables' situation was a terrible one. Medical
etiquette demanded his immediate retirement from the
case, but the promptings of humanity and the thought
of his client's important position in the world were too
strong for him. Throwing his scruples to the winds, he
assisted the aged peer on to a hastily improvised
stretcher and accompanied him to the Hall.</p>

<p>His lordship once in bed, the doctor examined him
again. It was obvious immediately that there was
only one hope of saving the patient's life. An injection
of anthro-philomelitis must be given without loss of
time.</p>

<p>Dr. Venables took off his coat and rolled up his
sleeves. He never travelled without a small bottle
of this serum in his waistcoat pocket&mdash;a serum which,
as my readers know, is prepared from the earth-worm,
in whose body (fortunately) large deposits of anthro-philomelitis
are continually found. With help from a
footman in holding down the patient, the injection
was made. In less than a year Lord Lair was restored
to health.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>Dr. Gordon Venables' case came before the British
Medical Council early in October. The counts in the
indictment were two.</p>

<p>The first was that, "on the 17th of June last, Dr.
Gordon Venables did feloniously and with malice
aforethought commit the disgusting and infamous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
crime of attending professionally the client of another
practitioner."</p>

<p>The second was that "in the course of rendering
professional services to the said client, Dr. Venables
did knowingly and wittingly employ the assistance of
one who was not a properly registered medical man, to
wit, Thomas Boiling, footman, thereby showing himself
to be a scurvy fellow of infamous morals."</p>

<p>Dr. Venables decided to apologise. He also decided
to send in an account to Lord Lair for two hundred and
fifty guineas. He justified this to himself mainly on
the ground that, according to a letter in that week's
<i>Lancet</i>, the supply of anthro-philomelitis in earth-worms
was suddenly giving out, and that it was necessary
to recoup himself for the generous quantity he
had injected into Lord Lair. Naturally, also, he felt
that his lordship, as the author of the whole trouble,
owed him something.</p>

<p>The Council, in consideration of his apology, dismissed
the first count. On the second count, however,
they struck him off the register.</p>

<p>It was a terrible position for a young doctor to be in,
but Gordon Venables faced it like a man. With Lord
Lair's fee in his pocket he came to town and took a
house in Harley Street. When he had paid the first
quarter's rent and the first instalment on the hired
furniture, he had fifty pounds left.</p>

<p>Ten pounds he spent on embossed stationery.</p>

<p>Forty pounds he spent on postage-stamps.</p>

<p>For the next three months no journal was complete
without a letter from 999 Harley Street, signed
"Gordon Venables," in which the iniquity of his
treatment by the British Medical Council was dwelt
upon with the fervour of a man who knew his subject
thoroughly; no such letter was complete without a
side-reference to anthro-philomelitis (as found, happily,
in earth-worms) and the anthro-philomelitis treatment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
(as recommended by peers). Six months previously
the name of Venables had been utterly unknown to
the man in the street. In three months' time it was
better known even than &mdash;&mdash;'s, the well-known &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>One-half of London said he was an infamous quack.</p>

<p>The other half of London said he was a martyred
genius.</p>

<p>Both halves agreed that, after all, one might as well
<i>try</i> this new what-you-may-call-it treatment, just to
see if there was anything <i>in</i> it, don't you know.</p>

<p>It was only last week that Mr. Venables made an
excellent speech against the super-tax.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_NEWSPAPER_PROPRIETOR" id="THE_NEWSPAPER_PROPRIETOR"></a>THE NEWSPAPER PROPRIETOR</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> great Hector Strong, lord of journalism
and swayer of empires, paced the floor of his
luxurious apartment with bowed head, his
corrugated countenance furrowed with lines of anxiety.
He had just returned from a lunch with all his favourite
advertisers ... but it was not this which troubled him.
He was thinking out a new policy for <i>The Daily Vane</i>.</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered something. Coming up to
town in his third motor, he had glanced through the
nineteen periodicals which his house had published
that morning, and in one case had noted matter for
serious criticism. This was obviously the first business
he must deal with.</p>

<p>He seated himself at his desk and pushed the bell
marked "38." Instantly a footman presented himself
with a tray of sandwiches.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" said Strong coldly.</p>

<p>"You rang for me, sir," replied the trembling menial.</p>

<p>"Go away," said Strong. Recognizing magnanimously,
however, that the mistake was his own, he
pressed bell "28." In another moment the editor of
<i>Sloppy Chunks</i> was before him.</p>

<p>"In to-day's number," said Strong, as he toyed with
a blue pencil, "you apologize for a mistake in last
week's number." He waited sternly.</p>

<p>"It was a very bad mistake, sir, I'm afraid. We did
a great injustice to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know my rule," said Strong. "The mistake
of last week I could have overlooked. The apology
of this week is a more serious matter. You will ask<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
for a month's salary on your way out." He pressed a
button and the editor disappeared through the trap-door.</p>

<p>Alone again, Hector Strong thought keenly for a
moment. Then he pressed bell "38." Instantly a
footman presented himself with a tray of sandwiches.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by this?" roared Strong, his
iron self-control for a moment giving way.</p>

<p>"I b-beg your pardon, sir," stammered the man.
"I th-thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get out!" As the footman retired, Strong passed
his hand across his forehead. "My memory is bad
to-day," he murmured, and pushed bell "48."</p>

<p>A tall thin man entered.</p>

<p>"Ah, good afternoon, Mr. Brownlow," said the
Proprietor. He toyed with his blue pencil. "Let me
see, which of our papers are under your charge at the
moment?"</p>

<p>Mr. Brownlow reflected.</p>

<p>"Just now," he said, "I am editing <i>Snippety Snips</i>,
<i>The Whoop</i>, <i>The Girls' Own Aunt</i>, <i>Parings</i>, <i>Slosh</i>, <i>The
Sunday Sermon</i>, and <i>Back Chat</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah! Well, I want you to take on <i>Sloppy Chunks</i>
too for a little while. Mr. Symes has had to leave us."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Mr. Brownlow bowed and moved to the
door.</p>

<p>"By the way," Strong said, "your last number of
<i>Slosh</i> was very good. Very good indeed. I congratulate
you. Good day."</p>

<p>Left alone, Hector Strong, lord of journalism and
swayer of empires, resumed his pacings. His two
mistakes with the bell told him that he was distinctly
not himself this afternoon. Was it only the need of a
new policy for <i>The Vane</i> which troubled him? Or was
it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Could it be Lady Dorothy?</p>

<p>Lady Dorothy Neal was something of an enigma to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Hector Strong. He was making more than a million
pounds a year, and yet she did not want to marry him.
Sometimes he wondered if the woman were quite sane.
Yet, mad or sane, he loved her.</p>

<p>A secretary knocked and entered. He waited submissively
for half an hour until the Proprietor looked up.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Lady Dorothy Neal would like to see you for a
moment, sir."</p>

<p>"Show her in."</p>

<p>Lady Dorothy came in brightly.</p>

<p>"What nice-looking men you have here," she said.
"Who is the one in the blue waistcoat? He has curly
hair."</p>

<p>"You didn't come to talk about <i>him</i>?" said Hector
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I didn't come to talk <i>to</i> him really, but if you keep
me waiting half an hour&mdash;&mdash; Why, what are you
doing?"</p>

<p>Strong looked up from the note he was writing. The
tender lines had gone from his face, and he had become
the stern man of action again.</p>

<p>"I am giving instructions that the services of my
commissionaire, hall-boy, and fifth secretary will no
longer be required."</p>

<p>"Don't do that," pleaded Dorothy.</p>

<p>Strong tore up the note and turned to her. "What
do you want of me?" he asked.</p>

<p>She blushed and looked down. "I&mdash;I have written
a&mdash;a play," she faltered.</p>

<p>He smiled indulgently. He did not write plays himself,
but he knew that other people did.</p>

<p>"When does it come off?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The manager says it will have to at the end of the
week. It came <i>on</i> a week ago."</p>

<p>"Well," he smiled, "if people don't want to go, I
can't make them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you can," she said boldly.</p>

<p>He gave a start. His brain working at lightning
speed saw the possibilities in an instant. At one stroke
he could win Lady Dorothy's gratitude, provide <i>The
Daily Vane</i> with a temporary policy, and give a convincing
exhibition of the power of his press.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Strong&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hector," he whispered. As he rose from his desk
to go to her, he accidentally pressed the button of the
trap-door. The next moment he was alone.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>"That the British public is always ready to welcome
the advent of a clean and wholesome home-grown play
is shown by the startling success of <i>Christina's
Mistake</i>, which is attracting such crowds to The King's
every night." So wrote <i>The Daily Vane</i>, and continued
in the same strain for a column.</p>

<p>"Clubland is keenly exercised," wrote <i>The Evening
Vane</i>, "over a problem of etiquette which arises in
the Second Act of <i>Christina's Mistake</i>, the great autumn
success at The King's Theatre. The point is shortly
this. Should a woman ..." And so on.</p>

<p>"A pretty little story is going the rounds," said
<i>Slosh</i>, "anent that charming little lady, Estelle Rito,
who plays the part of a governess in <i>Christina's
Mistake</i>, for which ('Manager' Barodo informs me)
advance booking up to Christmas has already been
taken. It seems that Miss Rito, when shopping in the
purlieus of Bond Street ..."</p>

<p><i>Sloppy Chunks</i> had a joke which set all the world
laughing. It was called&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Between the Acts</span></p>

<div class="lett"><div class="blockquot"><p><small><i>Flossie.</i> 'Who's the lady in the box with Mr. Johnson?'</small></p>

<p><small><i>Gussie.</i> 'Hush! It's his wife!'</small></p>

<p><small>And Flossie giggled so much that she could hardly listen to the
last Act of <i>Christina's Mistake</i>, which she had been looking
forward to for weeks!"</small></p></div></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Sunday Sermon</i> offered free tickets to a hundred
unmarried suburban girls, to which class <i>Christina's
Mistake</i> might be supposed to make a special religious
appeal. But they had to collect coupons first for <i>The
Sunday Sermon</i>.</p>

<p>And, finally, <i>The Times</i>, of two months later, said:</p>

<p>"A marriage has been arranged between Lady
Dorothy Neal, daughter of the Earl of Skye, and the
Hon. Geoffrey Bollinger."</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>Than a successful revenge nothing is sweeter in life.
Hector Strong was not the man to spare anyone who
had done him an injury. Yet I think his method of
revenging himself upon Lady Dorothy savoured of the
diabolical. He printed a photograph of her in <i>The
Daily Picture Gallery</i>. It was headed "The Beautiful
Lady Dorothy Neal."</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">When</span> Peter Plimsoll, the Glue King, died,
his parting advice to his sons to stick to the
business was followed only by John, the
elder. Adrian, the younger, had a soul above adhesion.
He disposed of his share in the concern and settled
down to follow the life of a gentleman of taste and
culture and (more particularly) patron of the arts.
He began in a modest way to collect ink-pots. His
range at first was catholic, and it was not until he had
acquired a hundred and forty-seven ink-pots of various
designs that he decided to make a speciality of historic
ones. This decision was hastened by the discovery
that one of Queen Elizabeth's inkstands&mdash;supposed
(by the owner) to be the identical one with whose aid
she wrote her last letter to Raleigh&mdash;was about to be
put on the market. At some expense Adrian obtained
an introduction, through a third party, to the owner;
at more expense the owner obtained, through the same
gentleman, an introduction to Adrian; and in less
than a month the great Elizabeth Ink-pot was safely
established in Adrian's house. It was the beginning
of the "Plimsoll Collection."</p>

<p>This was twenty years ago. Let us to-day take a
walk through the galleries of Mr. Adrian Plimsoll's
charming residence, which, as the world knows,
overlooks the park. Any friend of mine is always
welcome at Number Fifteen. We will start with the
North Gallery; I fear that I shall only have time to
point out a few of the choicest gems.</p>

<p>On the left is a Capricci comfit-box. If you have
never heard of Capricci, you oughtn't to come to a

<p>Here we have before us the historic de Montigny
topaz. Ask your little boy to tell you about it.</p>

<p>In the East Gallery, of course, the chief treasure is
the Santo di Santo amulet, described so minutely in
his <i>Vindici&aelig; Veritatis</i> by John of Flanders. The
original MS. of this book is in the South Gallery. You
must glance at it when we get there. It will save you
the trouble of ordering a copy from your library;
they would be sure to keep you waiting....</p>

<p>With some such words as these I lead my friends
round Number Fifteen. The many treasures in the
private parts of the house I may not show, of course;
the bathroom, for instance, in which hangs the finest
collection of portraits of philatelists that Europe can
boast. You must spend a night with Adrian to be
admitted to their company; and, as one of the elect,
I can assure you that nothing can be more stimulating
on a winter's morning than to catch the eye of Frisby
Dranger, F.Ph.S., behind the taps as your head first
emerges from the icy waters.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>Adrian Plimsoll sat at breakfast, sipping his hot
water and crumbling a dry biscuit. A light was in his
eye, a flush upon his pallid countenance. He had just
heard from a trusty agent that the Scutori breast-plate
had been seen in Devonshire. His car was ready
to take him to the station.</p>

<p>But alas! a disappointment awaited him. On close
examination the breast-plate turned out to be a
common Risoldo of inferior working. Adrian left the
house in disgust and started on his seven-mile walk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
back to the station. To complete his misery a sudden
storm came on. Cursing alternately his agent and
Risoldo, he made his way to a cottage and asked for
shelter.</p>

<p>An old woman greeted him civilly and bade him
come in.</p>

<p>"If I may just wait till the storm is over," said
Adrian, and he sat down in her parlour and looked
appraisingly (as was his habit) round the room. The
grandfather clock in the corner was genuine, but he
was beyond grandfather clocks. There was nothing
else of any value: three china dogs and some odd
trinkets on the chimney-piece; a print or two&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Stay! What was that behind the youngest
dog?</p>

<p>"May I look at that old bracelet?" he asked, his
voice trembling a little; and without waiting for permission
he walked over and took up the circle of tarnished
metal in his hands. As he examined it his
colour came and went, his heart seemed to stop beating.
With a tremendous effort he composed himself and
returned to his chair.</p>

<p><i>It was the Emperor's Bracelet!</i></p>

<p>Of course you know the history of this most famous
of all bracelets. Made by Spurius Quintus of Rome in
47 <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span>, it was given by C&aelig;sar to Cleopatra, who tried
without success to dissolve it in vinegar. Returning
to Rome by way of Antony, it was worn at a minor
conflagration by Nero, after which it was lost sight of
for many centuries. It was eventually heard of during
the reign of Canute (or Knut, as his admirers called
him); and John is known to have lost it in the Wash,
whence it was recovered a century afterwards. It
must have travelled thence to France, for it was seen
once in the possession of Louis XI; and from there
to Spain, for Philip the Handsome presented it to
Joanna on her wedding day. Columbus took it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
America, but fortunately brought it back again;
Peter the Great threw it at an indifferent musician;
on one of its later visits to England Pope wrote a
couplet to it. And the most astonishing thing in its
whole history was that now for more than a hundred
years it had vanished completely. To turn up again
in a little Devonshire cottage! Verily, truth is stranger
than fiction.</p>

<p>"That's rather a curious bracelet of yours," said
Adrian casually. "My&mdash;er&mdash;wife has one just like it,
which she asked me to match. Is it an old friend, or
would you care to sell it?"</p>

<p>"My mother gave it me," said the old woman, "and
she had it from hers. I don't know no further than
that. I didn't mean to sell it, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite right," said Adrian, "and, after all, I can
easily get another."</p>

<p>"But I won't say a bit of money wouldn't be useful.
What would you think a fair price, sir? Five shillings?"</p>

<p>Adrian's heart jumped. To get the Emperor's
bracelet for five shillings!</p>

<p>But the spirit of the collector rose up strong within
him. He laughed kindly.</p>

<p>"My good woman," he said, "they turn out
bracelets like that in Birmingham at two shillings
apiece. And quite new. I'll give you tenpence."</p>

<p>"Make it one-and-sixpence," she pleaded. "Times
are hard."</p>

<p>Adrian reflected. He was not, strictly speaking,
impoverished. He could afford one-and-sixpence.</p>

<p>"One-and-tuppence," he said.</p>

<p>"No, no, one-and-sixpence," she repeated obstinately.</p>

<p>Adrian reflected again. After all, he could always
sell it for ten thousand pounds, if the worst came to
the worst.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well," he sighed. "One-and-sixpence let it
be."</p>

<p>He counted out the money carefully. Then, putting
the precious bracelet in his pocket, he rose to go.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>Adrian has no relations living now. When he dies
he proposes to leave the Plimsoll Collection to the
nation, having&mdash;as far as he can foresee&mdash;no particular
use for it in the next world. This is really very generous
of him, and no doubt, when the time comes, the papers
will say so. But it is a pity that he cannot be appreciated
properly in his lifetime. Personally I should
like to see him knighted.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_ADVENTURER" id="THE_ADVENTURER"></a>THE ADVENTURER</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Lionel Norwood</span>, from his earliest days, had
been marked out for a life of crime. When
quite a child he was discovered by his nurse
killing flies on the window-pane. This was before the
character of the house-fly had become a matter of
common talk among scientists, and Lionel (like all
great men, a little before his time) had pleaded hygiene
in vain. He was smacked hastily and bundled off to a
preparatory school, where his aptitude for smuggling
sweets would have lost him many a half-holiday had
not his services been required at outside-left in the
hockey eleven. With some difficulty he managed to
pass into Eton, and three years later&mdash;with, one would
imagine, still more difficulty&mdash;managed to get superannuated.
At Cambridge he went down-hill rapidly.
He would think nothing of smoking a cigar in academical
costume, and on at least one occasion he drove
a dogcart on Sunday. No wonder that he was requested,
early in his second year, to give up his
struggle with the Little-go and betake himself back
to London.</p>

<p>London is always glad to welcome such people as
Lionel Norwood. In no other city is it so simple for a
man of easy conscience to earn a living by his wits.
If Lionel ever had any scruples (which, after a perusal
of the above account of his early days, it may be
permitted one to doubt) they were removed by an
accident to his solicitor, who was run over in the
Argentine on the very day that he arrived there with
what was left of Lionel's money. Reduced suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
to poverty, Norwood had no choice but to enter upon
a life of crime.</p>

<p>Except, perhaps, that he used slightly less hair-oil
than most, he seemed just the ordinary man about
town as he sat in his dressing-gown one fine summer
morning and smoked a cigarette. His rooms were
furnished quietly and in the best of taste. No signs
of his nefarious profession showed themselves to the
casual visitor. The appealing letters from the Princess
whom he was blackmailing, the wire apparatus which
shot the two of spades down his sleeve during the coon-can
nights at the club, the thimble and pea with which
he had performed the three-card trick so successfully
at Epsom last week&mdash;all these were hidden away
from the common gaze. It was a young gentleman of
fashion who lounged in his chair and toyed with a
priceless straight-cut.</p>

<p>There was a tap at the door, and Masters, his confidential
valet, came in.</p>

<p>"Well," said Lionel, "have you looked through the
post?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the man. "There's the usual
cheque from Her Highness, a request for more time
from the lady in Tite Street with twopence to pay on
the envelope, and banknotes from the Professor as
expected. The young gentleman of Hill Street has
gone abroad suddenly, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Lionel, with a sudden frown. "I
suppose you'd better cross him off our list, Masters."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I had ventured to do so, sir. I think
that's all, except that Mr. Snooks is glad to accept your
kind invitation to dinner and bridge to-night. Will
you wear the hair-spring coat, sir, or the metal clip?"</p>

<p>Lionel made no answer. He sat plunged in thought.
When he spoke it was about another matter.</p>

<p>"Masters," he said, "I have found out Lord Fairlie's
secret at last. I shall go to see him this afternoon."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Will you wear your revolver, sir, as it's
a first call?"</p>

<p>"I think so. If this comes off, Masters, it will make
our fortune."</p>

<p>"I hope so, I'm sure, sir." Masters placed the
whisky within reach and left the room silently.</p>

<p>Alone, Lionel picked up his paper and turned to the
Agony Column.</p>

<p>As everybody knows, the Agony Column of a daily
paper is not actually so domestic as it seems. When
"Mother" apparently says to "Floss," "Come
home at once. Father gone away for week. Bert and
Sid longing to see you," what is really happening is
that Barney Hoker is telling Jud Batson to meet him
outside the Duke of Westminster's little place at
3 a.m. precisely on Tuesday morning, not forgetting to
bring his jemmy and a dark lantern with him. And
Floss's announcement next day, "Coming home with
George," is Jud's way of saying that he will turn up all
right, and half thinks of bringing his automatic pistol
with him too, in case of accidents.</p>

<p>In this language&mdash;which, of course, takes some little
learning&mdash;Lionel Norwood had long been an expert.
The advertisement which he was now reading was
unusually elaborate:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Lost, in a taxi between Baker Street and Shepherd's
Bush, a gold-mounted umbrella with initials
'J. P.' on it. If Ellen will return to her father immediately
all will be forgiven. White spot on foreleg.
Mother very anxious and desires to return thanks for
kind enquiries. Answers to the name of Ponto. <i>Bis
dat qui cito dat.</i>"</p></div>

<p>What did it mean? For Lionel it had no secrets.
He was reading the revelation by one of his agents of
the skeleton in Lord Fairlie's cupboard!</p>

<p>Lord Fairlie was one of the most distinguished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
members of the Cabinet. His vein of high seriousness,
his lofty demeanour, the sincerity of his manner
endeared him not only to his own party, but even
(astounding as it may seem) to a few high-minded men
upon the other side, who admitted, in moments of
expansion which they probably regretted afterwards,
that he might, after all, be as devoted to his country
as they were. For years now his life had been without
blemish. It was impossible to believe that even in his
youth he could have sown any wild oats; terrible to
think that these wild oats might now be coming home
to roost.</p>

<p>"What do you require of me?" he said courteously
to Lionel, as the latter was shown into his study.</p>

<p>Lionel went to the point at once.</p>

<p>"I am here, my lord," he said, "on business. In the
course of my ordinary avocations"&mdash;the parliamentary
atmosphere seemed to be affecting his language&mdash;"I
ascertained a certain secret in your past life which,
if it were revealed, might conceivably have a not undamaging
effect upon your career. For my silence in
this matter I must demand a sum of fifty thousand
pounds."</p>

<p>Lord Fairlie had grown paler and paler as this speech
proceeded.</p>

<p>"What have you discovered?" he whispered.
Alas! he knew only too well what the damning answer
would be.</p>

<p>"<i>Twenty years ago</i>," said Lionel, "<i>you wrote a
humorous book</i>."</p>

<p>Lord Fairlie gave a strangled cry. His keen mind
recognized in a flash what a hold this knowledge would
give his enemies. <i>Shafts of Folly</i>, his book had been
called. Already he saw the leading articles of the
future:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We confess ourselves somewhat at a loss to know
whether Lord Fairlie's speech at Plymouth yesterday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
was intended as a supplement to his earlier work,
<i>Shafts of Folly</i>, or as a serious offering to a nation
impatient of levity in such a crisis...."</p>

<p>"The Cabinet's jester, in whom twenty years ago
the country lost an excellent clown without gaining a
statesman, was in great form last night...."</p>

<p>"Lord Fairlie has amused us in the past with his
clever little parodies; he may amuse us in the future;
but as a statesman we can only view him with disgust...."</p></div>

<p>"Well?" said Lionel at last. "I think your lordship
is wise enough to understand. The discovery of
a sense of humour in a man of your eminence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Lord Fairlie was already writing out the
cheque.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="THE_EXPLORER" id="THE_EXPLORER"></a>THE EXPLORER</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">As</span> the evening wore on&mdash;and one young man after
another asked Jocelyn Montrevor if she were
going to Ascot, what? or to Henley, what?
or what?&mdash;she wondered more and more if this were
all that life would ever hold for her. Would she never
meet a man, a real man who had <i>done</i> something?
These boys around her were very pleasant, she admitted
to herself; very useful indeed, she added, as
one approached her with some refreshment; but they
were only boys.</p>

<p>"Here you are," said Freddy, handing her an ice
in three colours. "I've had it made specially cold for
you. They only had the green, pink, and yellow
jerseys left; I hope you don't mind. The green part
is arsenic, I believe. If you don't want the wafer I'll
take it home and put it between the sashes of my
bedroom window. The rattling kept me awake all
last night. That's why I'm looking so ill, by the
way."</p>

<p>Jocelyn smiled kindly and went on with her ice.</p>

<p>"That reminds me," Freddy went on, "we've got
a nut here to-night. The genuine thing. None of your
society Barcelonas or suburban Filberts. One of the
real Cob family; the driving-from-the-sixth-tee, inset-on-the-right,
and New-Year's-message-to-the-country
touch. In short, a celebrity."</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Jocelyn eagerly. Perhaps here
was a man.</p>

<p>"Worrall Brice, the explorer. Don't say you haven't
heard of him or Aunt Alice will cry."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>Heard of him? Of course she had heard of him.
Who hadn't?</p>

<p>Worrall Brice's adventures in distant parts of the
empire would have filled a book&mdash;had, in fact, already
filled three. A glance at his flat in St. James's Street
gave you some idea of the adventures he had been
through. Here were the polished spurs of his companion
in the famous ride through Australia from
south to north&mdash;all that had been left by the cannibals
of the Wogga-Wogga River after their banquet. Here
was the poisoned arrow which, by the merciful intervention
of Providence, just missed Worrall and
pierced the heart of one of his black attendants, the
post-mortem happily revealing the presence of a new
and interesting poison. Here, again, was the rope with
which he was hanged by mistake as a spy in South
America&mdash;a mistake which would certainly have had
fatal results if he had not had the presence of mind to
hold his breath during the performance. In yet another
corner you might see his favourite mascot&mdash;a tooth of
the shark which bit him off the coast of China. Spears,
knives, and guns lined the walls; every inch of the
floor was covered by skins. His flat was typical of the
man&mdash;a man who had <i>done</i> things.</p>

<p>"Introduce him to me," commanded Jocelyn.
"Where is he?"</p>

<p>She looked up suddenly and saw him entering the
ball-room. He was of commanding height and his face
was the face of a man who has been exposed to the
forces of Nature. The wind, the waves, the sun, the
mosquito had set their mark upon him. Down one
side of his cheek was a newly healed scar, a scratch
from a hippopotamus in its last death-struggle. A
legacy from a bison seared his brow.</p>

<p>He walked with the soft easy tread of the python,
or the Pathan, or some animal with a "pth" in it.
Probably I mean the panther. He bore himself confidently,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
and his mouth was a trap from which no superfluous
word escaped. He was the strong silent man
of Jocelyn's dreams.</p>

<p>"Mr. Worrall Brice, Miss Montrevor," said Freddy,
and left them.</p>

<p>Worrall Brice bowed and stood beside her with
folded arms, his gaze fixed above her head.</p>

<p>"I shall not expect you to dance," said Jocelyn,
with a confidential smile which implied that he and
she were above such frivolities. As a matter of fact,
he could have taught her the Wogga-Wogga one-step,
the Bimbo, the Kiyi, the Ju-bu, the Head-hunter's Hug,
and many other cannibalistic steps which, later on,
were to become the rage of London and the basis of a
<i>revue</i>.</p>

<p>"I have often imagined you, as you kept watch
over your camp," she went on, "and I have seemed
myself to hear the savages and lions roaring outside the
circle of fire, what time in the swamps the crocodiles
were barking."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"It must be a wonderful life."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"If I were a man I should want to lead such a life;
to get away from all this," and she waved her hand
round the room, "back to Nature. To know that I
could not eat until I had first killed my dinner; that
I could not live unless I slew the enemy! That must
be fine!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Worrall.</p>

<p>"I cannot get Freddy to see it. He is quite content
to have shot a few grouse ... and once to have
wounded a beater. There must be more in life than
that."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I suppose I am elemental. Beneath the veneer of
civilization I am a savage. To wake up with the war-cry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
of the enemy in my ears, to sleep with the&mdash;er&mdash;barking
of the crocodile in my dreams, that is life!"</p>

<p>Worrall Brice tugged at his moustache and gazed
into space over her head. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>"Crocodiles don't bark," he said.</p>

<p>Jocelyn looked at him in astonishment. "But in
your book, <i>Through Trackless Paths</i>!" she cried.
"I know it almost by heart. It was you who taught
me. What are the beautiful words? 'On the banks
of the sleepy river two great crocodiles were barking.'"</p>

<p>"Not 'barking,'" said Worrall. "'Basking.' It
was a misprint."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Jocelyn. She had a moment's awful
memory of all the occasions when she had insisted that
crocodiles barked. There had been a particularly
fierce argument with Meta Richards, who had refused
to weigh even the printed word of Worrall Brice against
the silence of the Reptile House on her last visit to the
Zoo.</p>

<p>"Well," smiled Jocelyn, "you must teach me about
these things. Will you come and see me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Worrall. He rather liked to stand and
gaze into the distance while pretty women talked to
him. And Jocelyn was very pretty.</p>

<p>"We live in South Kensington. Come on Sunday,
won't you? 99 Peele Crescent."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Worrall.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>On Sunday Jocelyn waited eagerly for him in the
drawing-room of Peele Crescent. Her father was
asleep in the library, her mother was dead; so she
would have the great man to herself for an afternoon.
Later she would have him for always, for she meant to
marry him. And when they were married she was not
so sure that they would live with the noise of the
crocodile barking or coughing, or whatever it did, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
their ears. She saw herself in that little house in
Green Street with the noise of motor-horns and taxi-whistles
to soothe her to sleep.</p>

<p>Yet what a man he was! What had he said to her?
She went over all his words.... They were not
many.</p>

<p>At six o'clock she was still waiting in the drawing-room
at Peele Crescent....</p>

<p>At six-thirty Worrall Brice had got as far as Peele
Place....</p>

<p>At six-forty-five he found himself in Radcliffe
Square again....</p>

<p>At seven o'clock, just as he was giving himself up
for lost, he met a taxi and returned to St. James's
Street. He was a great traveller, but South Kensington
had been too much for him.</p>

<p>Next week he went back unmarried to the jungle.
It was the narrowest escape he had had.</p>
